Here are just a few examples:\n\nBusiness & MarketingManagementHuman ResourcesTourism & HospitalitySupply Chain & LogisticsInformation SystemsAccounting & FinanceEconomics\n\n\nYou can teach marketing frameworks and case studies, but you can’t easily let students practice pitching to demanding clients, responding to hostile customer feedback, or navigating real-time market changes. You can’t create 30 different competitive scenarios where market conditions shift unexpectedly.\n\n\nYou can teach organisational theory and change management models, but you can’t easily let students navigate complex team conflicts, make decisions with incomplete information, or experience the consequences of poor delegation in real time. You can’t give them multiple practice attempts at handling difficult conversations with stakeholders.\n\n\nYou can teach HR processes and employment law, but you can’t easily let students conduct recruitment interviews with difficult candidates, handle sensitive employee relations scenarios, or navigate discrimination claims. You can’t scale practice in complex interpersonal situations to all students.\n\n\nYou can teach customer service theory and hospitality principles, but you can’t easily let students handle demanding guests, manage service recovery in real scenarios, or navigate cultural differences in hospitality contexts. You can’t create dozens of authentic customer interaction scenarios.\n\n\nYou can teach supply chain theory and optimization models, but you can’t easily let students experience demand disruptions, supplier failures, or make real-time logistics decisions with uncertain information. You can’t scale practice in crisis management across complex networks.\n\n\nYou can teach systems analysis and project management methodology, but you can’t easily let students elicit requirements from difficult stakeholders, manage scope creep in projects, or navigate technical trade-offs under pressure. You can’t give them safe practice with implementation challenges.\n\n\nYou can teach accounting principles and financial analysis, but you can’t easily let students audit complex financial statements with errors, conduct forensic analysis, or navigate ambiguous accounting treatments. You can’t let them make and learn from valuation mistakes at scale.\n\n\nYou can teach economic theory and modelling, but you can’t easily let students work with real market volatility, make predictions and test them, or navigate policy trade-offs with competing stakeholder interests. You can’t simulate historical scenarios or generate synthetic economic data at scale.\n\n\n\nThe common challenge across all these disciplines: You can’t easily give every student practice in high-stakes, complex, realistic scenarios with immediate feedback and the freedom to fail safely.\nUntil now.",

    "text": "2.5 What Makes This Different from Traditional Teaching?\nTraditional business education often focuses on product,the final answer, the correct calculation, the right theoretical framework. Students write essays, complete exams, and submit reports that demonstrate they know things.\nBut professional business work is about process,the methodology of how you analyse financial data, the approach you take in strategic planning, the steps you follow to ensure market research validity, the communication style you use to negotiate deals.\nAI allows us to assess and teach process, not just product.\nHere’s what this means in your discipline:\n\nBusiness & MarketingManagementHuman ResourcesTourism & HospitalitySupply Chain & LogisticsInformation SystemsAccounting & FinanceEconomics\n\n\nTraditional: “Define the four Ps of marketing” (product knowledge) Process-focused: “Conduct a customer negotiation. Did you identify customer needs before proposing solutions? Did you use evidence to support your positioning?”\n\n\nTraditional: “Explain change management models” (knowledge recall) Process-focused: “You’re facing team resistance to change. How do you diagnose the source? How do you engage stakeholders? What’s your communication strategy?”\n\n\nTraditional: “List the steps in recruitment” (procedural knowledge) Process-focused: “Conduct an interview and evaluate fit. How did you probe beyond surface answers? Did you identify cultural alignment? How did you avoid bias?”\n\n\nTraditional: “Describe service recovery principles” (theoretical knowledge) Process-focused: “A guest is threatening to leave due to service failure. How do you listen? What do you offer? How do you rebuild trust?”\n\n\nTraditional: “Calculate EOQ and safety stock” (mathematical knowledge) Process-focused: “Your supplier just failed. Walk me through your decision-making. What trade-offs did you consider? How did you communicate with stakeholders?”\n\n\nTraditional: “Explain the SDLC” (methodological knowledge) Process-focused: “Elicit requirements from a demanding stakeholder. Did you ask clarifying questions? Did you document trade-offs? How did you manage scope creep?”\n\n\nTraditional: “Apply the going concern principle” (rules-based knowledge) Process-focused: “Audit this financial statement. What red flags did you identify? How did you investigate? What judgment calls did you make?”\n\n\nTraditional: “Define elasticity of demand” (theoretical knowledge) Process-focused: “Recommend a policy using economic analysis. How did you weight competing models? What assumptions did you question? How did you address uncertainty?”\n\n\n\nThis shift,from testing knowledge recall to evaluating applied professional methodology,is transformational for business education.",

    "section": "2.6 Three Core Principles of This Approach",
    "text": "2.6 Three Core Principles of This Approach\nAs you read through this book and begin experimenting with AI in your teaching, keep these three principles in mind:\n\n2.6.1 1. AI as Scaffolding, Not Replacement\nAI is like a construction crew that can quickly build the framework for complex learning scenarios. But your role as the educator is irreplaceable: you design the learning objectives, you set the ethical boundaries, you guide students to inspect and refine their work, and you ensure the final structure is robust and professionally sound.\nExamples of how this works across disciplines:\n\nBusiness & MarketingManagementHuman ResourcesTourism & HospitalitySupply Chain & LogisticsInformation SystemsAccounting & FinanceEconomics\n\n\nAI generates customer objections and competitive scenarios. You ensure the scenarios reflect realistic market conditions, teach students to validate market assumptions, and guide them to question data sources and competitive intelligence quality.\n\n\nAI creates team conflict scenarios and organisational situations. You ensure they reflect real organisational complexity, teach political awareness, and guide ethical decision-making about stakeholder management.\n\n\nAI generates candidates and employee scenarios. You ensure realistic workplace situations, teach about unconscious bias, and guide ethical judgment in sensitive situations.\n\n\nAI creates demanding guests and service scenarios. You ensure cultural authenticity, teach service excellence principles, and guide professional judgment about when to escalate.\n\n\nAI generates demand shocks and logistics problems. You validate the economic realism, teach about supply chain strategy, and guide systems thinking about complex trade-offs.\n\n\nAI elicits requirements and generates IT scenarios. You ensure technical feasibility, teach about legacy constraints, and guide realistic project management.\n\n\nAI generates financial statements and scenarios. You ensure accounting accuracy, teach professional standards, and guide ethical judgment in ambiguous situations.\n\n\nAI generates economic scenarios and policy situations. You ensure theoretical soundness, teach empirical rigor, and guide understanding of model limitations.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.6.2 2. Transparency Over Prohibition\nMany educators worry about students using AI to cheat. This book takes the opposite approach: give students the AI tools, teach them to use AI ethically, and grade them on their ability to critically evaluate and improve AI outputs.\nIn the real world, professionals across all business disciplines will use AI tools:\n\nBusiness & MarketingManagementHuman ResourcesTourism & HospitalitySupply Chain & LogisticsInformation SystemsAccounting & FinanceEconomics\n\n\nMarketing professionals use AI for market analysis and competitive intelligence. Our job is to teach students to validate AI-generated insights, question assumptions, and maintain ethical judgment about data usage.\n\n\nManagers use AI for organisational analysis and decision support. Our job is to teach students to recognize biases in AI recommendations, involve human stakeholders, and maintain accountability.\n\n\nHR professionals use AI for recruitment, scheduling, and employee analytics. Our job is to teach students to identify bias, maintain privacy, and ensure fair and legal practices.\n\n\nHospitality professionals use AI for revenue management and customer analytics. Our job is to teach students to balance automation with personalisation and maintain service quality.\n\n\nSupply chain professionals use AI for forecasting and optimization. Our job is to teach students to validate AI recommendations against real constraints and maintain supply chain resilience.\n\n\nIT professionals use AI for code generation, systems analysis, and automation. Our job is to teach students to review AI outputs, maintain security and quality, and understand when to override automation.\n\n\nFinance professionals use AI for analysis, forecasting, and risk assessment. Our job is to teach students to validate AI analysis, maintain professional skepticism, and ensure compliance.\n\n\nEconomists use AI for modelling and analysis. Our job is to teach students to validate assumptions, understand model limitations, and maintain rigor in economic reasoning.\n\n\n\nOur job isn’t to prevent AI use,it’s to ensure students can use AI tools responsibly, identify their limitations, and maintain human judgment on ethical, legal, and disciplinary-specific matters.\n\n\n2.6.3 3. Start Simple, Scale Gradually\nYou don’t need to revolutionize your entire curriculum tomorrow. This book will show you how to start with a single prompt, try one simulation exercise, or enhance one assessment. Each chapter builds progressively, so you can adopt techniques at your own pace.",

If you’re concerned about losing control of your teaching, you won’t,you’ll gain new capabilities.\nThe goal of this book is simple: by the end, you should feel excited and equipped to try one new thing in your next class.\nThat’s it. One simulation. One new assessment approach. One conversation where a student gets to practice being a business professional in a safe environment before they step into the real world.\nBecause ultimately, that’s what we’re here for: to send confident, competent, ethical business professionals out into workplaces where they’ll face situations we can’t fully predict or control. AI gives us a way to prepare them better.\nLet’s begin.\n\nNext Chapter Preview: In Chapter 2, you’ll have your first conversation with an AI tool. We’ll walk through exactly what to type, what to expect, and how to think about prompts as instructions to a very capable (but not infallible) assistant.",

    "text": "3.7 Key Concepts for Leaders\n\n3.7.1 1. Garbage In, Garbage Out\nAI learns from data. If your data is:\n\nBiased → Your AI will be biased\nIncomplete → Your AI will have blind spots\nWrong → Your AI will make wrong decisions\n\nExample: If you train a hiring AI on past hires, and your company has historically hired mostly men for engineering roles, the AI will learn to prefer male candidates. Not because it’s sexist, but because that’s the pattern in the data.\nLesson: Data quality matters more than algorithm sophistication.\n\n\n3.7.2 2. AI Optimizes for What You Tell It To\nAI does exactly what you ask—which might not be what you want.\nExample:\n\nYou tell AI: “Minimise call centre wait times”\nAI learns: Hang up on customers quickly (technically reduces wait time!)\nYou wanted: Resolve issues faster (different metric!)\n\nLesson: Choose your success metrics carefully. AI will find the fastest path to that number.\n\n\n3.7.3 3. AI Doesn’t “Understand” Like Humans\nAI finds statistical patterns. It doesn’t understand meaning or context the way humans do.\nExample:\n\nHuman: “Can you open the window?” → Understands you want fresh air\nAI: Might interpret literally, might not understand it’s a request, might not know what “window” means in context\n\nLesson: Don’t assume AI understands nuance, sarcasm, context, or implied meaning.\n\n\n3.7.4 4. The Black Box Problem\nDeep learning AI can’t always explain its decisions.\nExample:\n\nAI denies a loan application\nApplicant asks: “Why?”\nAI effectively says: “Based on 10,000 patterns in millions of data points…”\nThat’s not a satisfying answer\n\nLesson: For decisions that affect people (hiring, lending, healthcare), you need explainability. Choose simpler AI that can explain, or have humans review AI decisions.\n\n\n3.7.5 5. AI Needs Continuous Maintenance\nAI isn’t “set it and forget it.” The world changes, and AI needs to adapt.\nExample:\n\nYou train an AI on customer behaviour in 2019\nCOVID changes everything in 2020\nYour AI is now making predictions based on outdated patterns\nIt needs to be retrained",

If historical data shows bias, AI learns that bias.\n\n\n3.8.2 “AI will automate my job away”\nReality: AI automates tasks, not jobs. Most jobs are bundles of tasks. Some tasks get automated, new tasks emerge.\n\n\n3.8.3 “AI is expensive and only for big companies”\nReality: Cloud AI services make it affordable. Small businesses use AI for scheduling, inventory, marketing, customer service.\n\n\n3.8.4 “We need to understand the math to use AI”\nReality: You don’t need to understand the engine to drive a car. You need to understand what AI can do, its limitations, and how to manage it.\n\n\n3.8.5 “AI makes mistakes, so we shouldn’t use it”\nReality: Humans make mistakes too.

    "text": "4.6 What LLMs Cannot Do (Or Do Poorly)\n\n4.6.1 Reliable Factual Accuracy\nThe problem: LLMs can “hallucinate” - confidently state false information\nExample:\nYou ask: “Who won the 2024 Nobel Prize in Literature?”\nLLM might say: “Jane Smith for her novel ‘The Silent Echo’” (completely made up)\nWhy it happens:\n\nLLM is predicting plausible-sounding text\nIt doesn’t “know” facts, it predicts likely word patterns\nIf it doesn’t know, it guesses based on similar patterns\n\nLesson for business:\n\nDon’t use LLMs for legal, medical, or financial advice without human verification\nDo use LLMs to draft content that humans then verify\nDo combine LLMs with verified databases (retrieval-augmented generation)\n\n\n\n\n4.6.2 Real-Time or Recent Information\nThe problem: LLMs only know what was in their training data (usually cut off months/years ago)\nExample: You ask: “What happened in the stock market today?” LLM: Can’t answer - its training data ended months ago\nWhy it happens:\n\nTraining happened at a specific point in time\nThe model is “frozen” after training\nIt can’t browse the internet or access current data (unless specifically connected to search)\n\nLesson for business: - ✗ Don’t ask for current prices, stock quotes, weather, news - ✓ Do connect LLM to real-time data sources (databases, APIs) - ✓ Do use for tasks where current information isn’t critical\n\n\n\n4.6.3 True Reasoning and Logic\nThe problem: LLMs pattern-match; they don’t reason logically\nExample:\nYou ask: “If it takes 5 machines 5 minutes to make 5 widgets, how long does it take 100 machines to make 100 widgets?”\nCommon LLM mistake: “100 minutes” (pattern-matching “100 and 100”)\nCorrect answer: “5 minutes” (requires logical thinking)\nWhy it happens:\n\nLLMs predict plausible-sounding text based on patterns\nThey don’t actually “think through” problems step by step\nComplex reasoning requires logic LLMs don’t truly have\n\nLesson for business:\n\nDon’t use for complex calculations, logic puzzles, or critical reasoning\nDo use for tasks where pattern recognition is enough\nDo verify any logical claims the LLM makes\n\n\n\n\n4.6.4 Understanding Context Outside the Conversation\nThe problem: LLMs don’t remember past conversations (unless you’re in the same session)\nExample:\nYesterday: “My name is John and I work at RetailFlow”\nToday: “What company do I work for?”\nLLM: “I don’t have that information”\nWhy it happens:\n\nEach conversation session is isolated\nLLM has no persistent memory\nIt only knows what’s in the current conversation\n\nLesson for business:\n\nDon’t expect LLM to remember previous interactions\nDo provide context each time (“I’m analysing RetailFlow’s customer data…”)\nDo build systems that pass context to the LLM explicitly\n\n\n\n\n4.6.5 True Creativity\nThe problem: LLMs remix and combine, but don’t have original insights\nExample:\nYou ask: “Invent a revolutionary new business model”\nLLM: Will suggest combinations of existing models, not truly novel ideas\nWhy it happens:\n\nLLM can only recombine patterns it’s seen\nCan’t have the “eureka moment” of genuine innovation\nCreativity looks like remixing existing ideas in new ways\n\nLesson for business:\n\nDon’t expect breakthrough innovations or original strategies\nDo use for brainstorming variations on existing ideas\nDo use to explore possibilities you might not have considered",

    "text": "4.7 How Businesses Use LLMs\n\n4.7.1 Customer Service\nCommon use: First-line chatbot for customer inquiries\nHow it works:\n\nCustomer asks question\nLLM generates response based on knowledge base\nSimple questions: LLM answers directly\nComplex questions: Routes to human agent with context\n\nBenefits:\n\n24/7 availability\nInstant responses to routine questions\nFrees humans for complex issues\n\nChallenges:\n\nMay give wrong information (hallucination risk)\nCan’t handle frustrated or emotional customers as well\nNeeds regular monitoring and refinement\n\nSuccess example: E-commerce company uses LLM for order tracking, returns, and product questions. 70% of inquiries resolved without human intervention. Customer satisfaction remained high (82%) for LLM-handled queries.\n\n\n\n4.7.2 Content Creation\nCommon use: Drafting marketing copy, product descriptions, social media\nHow it works:\n\nMarketing team provides brief and key points\nLLM generates draft in brand voice\nHuman edits, refines, approves\n\nBenefits:\n\n5x faster content creation\nConsistent brand voice\nA/B testing multiple versions quickly\n\nChallenges:\n\nGeneric output without human refinement\nNeeds clear brand guidelines and examples\nHuman oversight essential for quality\n\nSuccess example: Retail company uses LLM to write product descriptions. Human provides: product specs, target audience, key benefits. LLM generates 100 descriptions in minutes. Human editors review and refine top candidates.\n\n\n\n4.7.3 Knowledge Management\nCommon use: Internal Q&A system for company knowledge\nHow it works:\n\nLLM trained on company documents, policies, procedures\nEmployees ask questions in natural language\nLLM finds relevant information and explains it\nProvides links to source documents\n\nBenefits:\n\nFaster onboarding\nReduced help desk load\nKnowledge accessible to everyone\n\nChallenges:\n\nKeeping training data up-to-date\nEnsuring accuracy of information\nIntegrating with existing systems\n\nSuccess example: Tech company builds internal assistant trained on HR policies, IT procedures, and product documentation. New employees can ask questions 24/7. Reduced HR help desk tickets by 40%.\n\n\n\n4.7.4 Code and Analysis\nCommon use: Helping analysts write SQL, Python, or Excel formulas\nHow it works:\n\nAnalyst describes what they need in plain English\nLLM generates the code\nAnalyst reviews, tests, adjusts\n\nBenefits:\n\nNon-programmers can extract data\nFaster analysis\nLearning tool (see how LLM solves problems)\n\nChallenges:\n\nGenerated code may have bugs\nSecurity risks if code isn’t reviewed\nMay not follow company coding standards\n\nSuccess example: Finance team uses LLM to generate SQL queries. Analysts describe what data they need, LLM writes query, analyst reviews and runs. Analysis time cut by 60%.\n\n\n\n4.7.5 Document Processing\nCommon use: Summarizing, extracting information from documents\nHow it works:\n\nUpload long document (contract, report, proposal)\nLLM summarizes key points\nExtracts specific information (dates, amounts, terms)\nHuman reviews summary and makes decisions\n\nBenefits:\n\nProcess large volumes quickly\nConsistent extraction format\nFocus human time on decision-making\n\nChallenges:\n\nMay miss subtle details\nNeeds verification for critical documents\nFormatting issues with complex documents\n\nSuccess example: Legal team processes 100+ contracts per week. LLM summarizes key terms, flags unusual clauses, extracts deadlines. Lawyers review summaries instead of full documents unless flagged. Time savings: 50%.",

Don’t use for math, current events, or critical factual accuracy without verification.\nAlways have human oversight - LLMs hallucinate, have biases, and make mistakes. Humans review before outputs go to customers or affect decisions.\nStart small and measure - Pilot with low-risk use cases. Track accuracy, quality, and satisfaction. Iterate based on results.\nThey’re tools, not magic - LLMs are powerful but limited. Success comes from using them well, not just using them.",

    "text": "5.3 Step 2: Understanding Prompts\nA prompt is simply the instruction or question you type into the AI tool. Think of it like briefing a very capable research assistant who:\n\nHas read an enormous amount of material on nearly every subject\nCan generate text, analyse situations, and role-play scenarios\nFollows your instructions literally (which is both powerful and requires precision)\nDoesn’t have opinions, emotions, or genuine understanding,just pattern recognition\n\nThe quality of what you get back depends almost entirely on the quality of your prompt.\n\n5.3.1 Why Prompts Matter: The Foundation of All AI\nHere’s something important to understand: Every AI tool, no matter how sophisticated, is fundamentally powered by prompts.\nWhether you’re: - Typing directly into ChatGPT - Using MS Copilot in Word - Working with specialized teaching tools - Exploring emerging automation platforms - Building custom agents\n…at the heart, there’s a prompt (or series of prompts) that tells the AI what to do.\nThe anatomy of every AI interaction:\nSystem Prompt (hidden): \"You are a helpful AI assistant for education...\"\n[Optional: Rules, context, instructions about how to behave]\n\nUser Prompt (your input): \"Create a quiz about supply chain management\"\n\nResult: AI output based on both prompts combined\nWhy this matters: - Learning to write clear prompts is learning to communicate effectively with AI - Whether it’s a standalone tool or integrated into Word, the principles are the same - When you see AI integrated into traditional software (increasingly common), you’re seeing a prompt window embedded in familiar tools - Understanding prompts gives you conceptual mastery,specific tools will change, but prompting skills transfer\nYour progression in this book: 1. Chapter 2-4 (this section): Master basic prompting concepts and techniques 2. Chapters 5-12: Apply prompting to specific teaching scenarios 3. Chapter 13: Transform static content to interactive using prompts 4. Chapter 14: See how prompts scale through automation and agents\nThis chapter teaches you the foundation. Everything else builds on it.\nLet’s see prompts in action.",

    "section": "5.6 The CRAFT Framework: One Approach to Structured Prompting",
    "text": "5.6 The CRAFT Framework: One Approach to Structured Prompting\nLet’s break down what made that second prompt powerful using a memorable framework: CRAFT.\nThis framework works whether you’re using ChatGPT, Copilot, Claude, or any other AI tool. CRAFT is a helpful starting point for structuring your thinking.\nImportant caveat: CRAFT is not the only way to prompt effectively. Some educators find other frameworks work better for them. Some prefer different approaches entirely. The goal isn’t to follow CRAFT rigidly,it’s to think intentionally about what you’re asking the AI to do.\nFor example, the C.R.E.A.T.E. framework takes a different approach, emphasizing examples and iterative refinement rather than upfront context. See Appendix E for a detailed comparison of C.R.E.A.T.E. vs. C.R.A.F.T. frameworks.\n\n5.6.1 The CRAFT Acronym\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLetter\nElement\nExample\n\n\n\n\nC\nContext\n“This is for my undergraduate marketing unit covering competitive strategy”\n\n\nR\nRole\n“You are an experienced marketing director”\n\n\nA\nAction\n“Create a case study about a product launch decision”\n\n\nF\nFormat\n“300-400 words with three discussion questions at the end”\n\n\nT\nTone/Target\n“Professional and realistic— suitable for university students”\n\n\n\nYou don’t need to use every element every time, but this gives you a clear structure to work with.\n\n\n5.6.2 Breaking Down Each Element\n\n5.6.2.1 C: Context - Set the situation\n\n“This is for my undergraduate marketing unit. Students have learned about competitive positioning and market analysis.”\n\nWhy it matters: Helps AI understand what background knowledge students already have and what level of sophistication to aim for.\nDiscipline examples:\n\nBusiness & MarketingManagementHuman ResourcesTourism & HospitalitySupply Chain & LogisticsInformation SystemsAccounting & FinanceEconomics\n\n\n“This is for an introductory marketing course where students are learning about digital customer acquisition strategies.”\n\n\n“This is for a management unit on organisational change where students have covered Kotter’s 8-step model.”\n\n\n“This is for an HR management course on employee relations and conflict resolution.”\n\n\n“This is for a hospitality management unit focused on service recovery and customer experience design.”\n\n\n“This is for a supply chain management course on disruption management and network resilience.”\n\n\n“This is for an IT project management unit where students have learned agile and waterfall approaches.”\n\n\n“This is for an intermediate accounting course on financial analysis and audit methodology.”\n\n\n“This is for a microeconomics course on market structures and competitive dynamics.”\n\n\n\n\n\n5.6.2.2 R: Role - Define the perspective\n\n“You are an experienced marketing director”\n\nWhy it matters: The role shapes the tone, vocabulary, and approach. “Marketing director” will sound different from “market researcher” even when discussing the same topic.\nDiscipline examples:\n\nBusiness & MarketingManagementHuman ResourcesTourism & HospitalitySupply Chain & LogisticsInformation SystemsAccounting & FinanceEconomics\n\n\n“You are an experienced marketing director launching a new product” or “You are a market research analyst evaluating competitive positioning”\n\n\n“You are a senior manager navigating organisational change” or “You are an executive coach helping with team dynamics”\n\n\n“You are an HR business partner handling sensitive employee situations” or “You are a recruitment specialist evaluating candidate fit”\n\n\n“You are a hotel general manager managing service delivery” or “You are a guest services trainer improving customer experience”\n\n\n“You are a supply chain manager handling network optimization” or “You are a logistics director managing disruption”\n\n\n“You are an IT project manager implementing enterprise systems” or “You are a systems analyst gathering requirements”\n\n\n“You are an auditor evaluating financial statements” or “You are a financial analyst making investment recommendations”\n\n\n“You are an economist advising on policy decisions” or “You are a researcher analysing economic trends”\n\n\n\n\n\n5.6.2.3 A: Action - Specify what to create\n\n“Create a case study about a product launch decision”\n\nWhy it matters: Be specific about what you want. “Create a case study” is clearer than “write something about strategy.”\n\n\n5.6.2.4 F: Format - Describe the structure\n\n“300-400 words with three discussion questions at the end”\n\nWhy it matters: Format constraints guide the AI and prevent it from delivering something unusable. Too long? Too short? Wrong structure? Format prevents that.\nExamples: - “Bullet point list with 5-7 items” - “Conversational dialogue between two characters” - “Table with three columns: Challenge, Strategy, Outcome” - “Step-by-step instructions numbered 1-10”\n\n\n5.6.2.5 T: Tone/Target - Set the style and level\n\n“Professional and realistic, suitable for university students who are new to this topic”\n\nWhy it matters: This prevents the AI from pitching too high (too academic) or too low (too simplistic).\nExamples by level: - Introductory: “Use simple, clear language. Avoid jargon.” - Intermediate: “Assume students understand basic concepts. Use professional terminology.” - Advanced: “Use sophisticated analysis. Reference theoretical frameworks and empirical research.”\n\n\n\n\n5.6.3 Alternative Approaches: There’s More Than One Way\nCRAFT is helpful, but it’s not the only effective prompting approach. Depending on your thinking style and what you’re trying to achieve, these alternatives might work better:\n\n5.6.3.1 Ask for Step-by-Step Thinking\nInstead of relying on CRAFT structure, ask the AI to show its reasoning:\n\"I need a supply chain risk analysis. Before you give me recommendations,\nwalk me through your thinking: What are the main risk categories?\nWhat information would help identify which risks matter most?\nThen provide your analysis.\"\nThis gets at how the AI thinks, not just what it outputs.\n\n\n5.6.3.2 Provide Examples of What You Want\nSometimes showing is better than telling:\n\"Here's what a GOOD case study looks like for my students:\n[example of strong case study from your files]\n\nHere's what a WEAK case study looks like:\n[example of weak case study]\n\nNow create a case study for [your topic] that matches the GOOD example's quality.\"\nThis uses your expertise to calibrate the AI, rather than relying on CRAFT’s generic structure.\n\n\n5.6.3.3 Request Comparative Approaches\nAsk the AI to explore multiple angles:\n\"Show me three different ways to explain this accounting concept:\n1. For a student who learns visually\n2. For a student who learns through examples\n3. For a student who prefers logical frameworks\n\nThen tell me which approach seems most effective.\"\nThis creates conversation and exploration, not just output.\n\n\n5.6.3.4 Use Iterative Exploration\nStart vague, then get more specific as you see what the AI generates:\nPROMPT 1: \"What are the key ethical issues in AI implementation in healthcare?\"\n[AI responds with 5 issues]\n\nPROMPT 2: \"Which of those is most relevant to Australian healthcare compliance?\"\n[AI elaborates on one issue]\n\nPROMPT 3: \"How would you teach students to analyse this issue?\"\n[AI proposes teaching approach]\n\nPROMPT 4: \"What's a scenario that would help students understand this?\"\n[AI creates scenario you can then refine]\nNotice: you don’t need a perfect first prompt. You explore together.\n\n\n\n\n5.6.4 The Philosophy: Conversation Over One-Shot Prompting\nHere’s a crucial insight: One-shot prompts (even well-structured CRAFT ones) tend to produce “AI sameness.”\nWhen you send one prompt and take the output as-is, you get: - Generic content that could work for anyone - Safe middle-ground responses - Missing your specific teaching voice and perspective - The same tone the AI uses for every other prompt\nThe solution: Have a conversation.\nReal teaching improvement comes from iterative exploration where: - You share your thinking (“Here’s what I want students to understand…”) - The AI responds (“Here are three ways to approach this…”) - You push back or build (“Good, but can we make it less academic?” or “Add this element…”) - The result emerges through back-and-forth\nThis is why the Seven Techniques (in Chapter 4) matter more than perfect prompt structure. Techniques like Chain of Thought, Pros/Cons Analysis, and Role Play are conversation tools,they invite the AI to think alongside you, not just execute your commands.\n\n\n\n5.6.5 Complete CRAFT Example\nHere’s how all five elements work together:\nContext: \"This is for my undergraduate Business course on marketing strategy.\"\n\nRole: \"You are an experienced marketing director.\"\n\nAction: \"Create a case study about a product launch decision where the company faces competitive threats.\"\n\nFormat: \"300-400 words with three discussion questions requiring students to analyse market strategy and positioning.\"\n\nTone/Target: \"Professional and realistic. Use clear language suitable for first-year university students.\"\nThis is the “powerful” prompt we tried earlier. Now you can see why it’s powerful,it includes all five CRAFT elements.\n\n\n\n5.6.6 CRAFT as a Starting Point, Not the Endpoint\nHere’s something crucial: CRAFT is your first message, not your only message.\nThe best results come from conversations, not one-shot commands.\n\n5.6.6.1 Why This Matters\nIf you use CRAFT and stop, you get: - A competent response - But it’s generic and somewhat “AI-sounding” - Likely missing your teaching perspective - Probably not exactly what you actually need\nIf you use CRAFT and then have a conversation, you get: - Content shaped by your specific context - Your teaching voice reflected in the output - Solutions to problems the first prompt didn’t anticipate - Something genuinely useful for YOUR students\n\n\n5.6.6.2 The Conversation Pattern\nAfter your initial CRAFT prompt, you can: 1. Refine: “Can you make the discussion questions more challenging?” 2. Expand: “Add a section about the financial impact of this decision.” 3. Adapt: “Rewrite this for postgraduate students instead of undergraduates.” 4. Repurpose: “Turn this into a 10-slide PowerPoint presentation.” 5. Push back: “That’s too generic. Here’s what I actually need…” and keep talking\nYou’re not just telling the AI what to do,you’re working together to get exactly what you need.\nThis conversation approach is why Chapters 4-7 focus on techniques (Reverse Prompting, Pros/Cons, Chain of Thought, etc.) rather than just prompting structure. Those techniques are conversation starters, not rigid templates.",

    "section": "5.9 Beyond Your First Prompt: The Follow-Up Conversation",
    "text": "5.9 Beyond Your First Prompt: The Follow-Up Conversation\nHere’s the secret that most people miss: the best results come from a conversation, not a single prompt.\nYour first CRAFT prompt gets you started. Your follow-up prompts make it actually useful for your teaching.\n\n5.9.1 Common Follow-Up Patterns\nAfter your initial CRAFT prompt generates something, you can have a conversation to refine it:\n\n5.9.1.1 Pattern 1: Refine for Your Exact Needs\nInitial prompt: CRAFT framework generates a case study\nFollow-up: “Can you make the discussion questions more challenging? Students should need to apply the frameworks we’ve covered, not just recall information.”\nWhy this works: The AI understood your context from the first prompt. Now you’re fine-tuning toward excellence.\n\n\n5.9.1.2 Pattern 2: Adapt for Different Audiences\nInitial prompt: Generate a finance case study for undergraduate students\nFollow-up: “Rewrite this for postgraduate students. Assume they understand ratio analysis and want more sophisticated valuation challenges.”\nWhy this works: The core content doesn’t need to be regenerated; it just needs repositioning.\n\n\n5.9.1.3 Pattern 3: Expand with Additional Dimensions\nInitial prompt: Create an HR scenario\nFollow-up: “Add a section about the legal and compliance implications. Include references to relevant employment law.”\nWhy this works: You’re building on what works rather than starting from scratch.\n\n\n5.9.1.4 Pattern 4: Repurpose Into Multiple Formats\nInitial prompt: Generate a supply chain analysis framework\nFollow-up 1: “Turn this into a 10-slide PowerPoint with speaker notes.” Follow-up 2: “Create a checklist version students can print and use in class.” Follow-up 3: “Write a 2-minute explanation of this framework for a podcast.”\nWhy this works: One good idea becomes multiple teaching assets.\n\n\n\n5.9.2 Real Example: Conversation in Action\nHere’s how a conversation might unfold:\nPROMPT 1 (Initial CRAFT):\nContext: \"This is for my second-year marketing unit on competitive strategy.\"\nRole: \"You are an experienced marketing director.\"\nAction: \"Create a market analysis case study.\"\nFormat: \"500 words with 4 discussion questions\"\nTone: \"Professional, suitable for university students.\"\n\nAI OUTPUT: [Case study about streaming service competition]\n\nPROMPT 2 (Refine):\n\"Great! Can you make the discussion questions more specific?\nInstead of asking 'What's wrong?' ask students to identify:\n- Which Porter's Five Forces are most important here?\n- How would you calculate market share?\n- What data would you need to support your recommendation?\"\n\nAI OUTPUT: [Same case study, improved questions aligned with course framework]\n\nPROMPT 3 (Expand):\n\"Add a section showing three different market analysis approaches\nand how each one would lead to different conclusions. Include:\n- Porter's Five Forces\n- Ansoff Matrix\n- SWOT analysis\"\n\nAI OUTPUT: [Expanded case study with multiple analytical frameworks]\n\nPROMPT 4 (Repurpose):\n\"Turn this into a 10-minute classroom activity. Include:\n- 2-minute scenario introduction for students\n- 5-minute small group analysis task\n- 3-minute discussion and comparison of frameworks\"\n\nAI OUTPUT: [Classroom activity structured for your timing]\nNotice: you didn’t write four prompts from scratch. You had a conversation where each follow-up built on what was working.\n\n\n5.9.3 Types of Follow-Up Prompts by Discipline\n\nBusiness & MarketingManagementHuman ResourcesTourism & HospitalitySupply Chain & LogisticsInformation SystemsAccounting & FinanceEconomics\n\n\nRefine: “Make the competitive analysis more realistic,include actual market data from Australian retail” Adapt: “Rewrite this for students with no marketing background” Expand: “Add customer perception data and explain how it changes the analysis” Repurpose: “Create a 1-page executive summary version for busy managers”\n\n\nRefine: “Make the stakeholder conflicts more nuanced,not just good vs. bad decisions” Adapt: “Rewrite for public sector context instead of private company” Expand: “Add the perspective of each stakeholder and explain their reasoning” Repurpose: “Turn this into a role-play activity where students play different stakeholders”\n\n\nRefine: “Include specific Australian employment law references for this scenario” Adapt: “Rewrite for a small business context instead of multinational” Expand: “Add information about possible employee grievance or legal challenge” Repurpose: “Create a training guide for new HR staff based on this scenario”\n\n\nRefine: “Make the customer service challenge more complex,multiple guests, conflicting needs” Adapt: “Set this in an Australian luxury hotel instead of mid-range” Expand: “Add budget constraints and explain the trade-offs” Repurpose: “Turn this into a 5-station rotation activity for staff training”\n\n\nRefine: “Include real logistics costs and supply chain complexity” Adapt: “Rewrite for Australian manufacturing context” Expand: “Add supply chain disruption scenario,how does your solution handle it?” Repurpose: “Create a simulation where students track changes week by week”\n\n\nRefine: “Include technical constraints and legacy system integration challenges” Adapt: “Rewrite for a non-technical stakeholder audience” Expand: “Add cybersecurity and data governance requirements” Repurpose: “Turn this into a sprint-based project management simulation”\n\n\nRefine: “Include accounting ambiguity where multiple treatments are defensible” Adapt: “Rewrite for Australian tax and accounting standards context” Expand: “Add audit evidence requirements and explain what’s sufficient” Repurpose: “Create a checklist auditors use when reviewing this situation”\n\n\nRefine: “Include actual market data and explain why real markets deviate from theory” Adapt: “Use Australian economic data instead of generic examples” Expand: “Show how government policy changes would affect this analysis” Repurpose: “Create a data visualization exercise from this scenario”\n\n\n\n\n\n5.9.4 Key Principle: You’re the Director\nThink of yourself as a director, not a subordinate giving orders.\n\nThe AI is your assistant generating drafts\nYou’re evaluating, refining, and improving those drafts\nEach follow-up question shapes the output toward excellence\nYou stop when it’s ready for your class\n\nThis is what makes AI powerful for teaching: you stay in control while multiplying your output quality.",

    "text": "5.14 A Note on Conversation Length and Context\nWhen you start having longer conversations with AI,iterating on a unit design, asking follow-up questions, building on earlier work,you might eventually notice that outputs become less consistent or less accurate. This is a context management issue: as conversations grow very long, AI has limitations on what it can reliably track.\nDon’t worry about this for simple prompts. But as you move to more complex work, see Chapter 6 (Managing LLM Context) for strategies to keep conversations focused and high-quality. You’ll learn techniques like: - Breaking complex tasks into steps - Starting new conversations when appropriate - Explicitly restating context to keep AI on track\nFor now, just be aware: if a long conversation starts feeling unwieldy, that’s normal. Chapter 6 shows you how to manage it.\n\nNext Chapter Preview: In Chapter 3, you’ll learn the week-by-week timeline for integrating AI into your teaching. Chapter 4 then introduces seven essential prompting techniques,specific approaches that develop different critical thinking skills in your students. Each technique is more sophisticated than “write a prompt,” but all of them build on the foundations you’ve just mastered.",

    "section": "6.4 Why This Works: The Interview Advantage",
    "text": "6.4 Why This Works: The Interview Advantage\nWhen you ask AI to interview you before making recommendations, several important things happen:\n\n6.4.1 1. Contextual Depth\nAI doesn’t know anything about you initially. By asking sequential questions, it builds a comprehensive picture of: - Your discipline (Is it HR management? Marketing? Accounting? Supply chain?) and how your students learn in that field - Your teaching context (Are you working with first-years or postgraduates? Large cohorts or seminars? Practical or theoretical focus?) - Your students’ needs and challenges - Your constraints and resources - What success actually looks like for your teaching\nThis context is invaluable. Generic advice for “educators” doesn’t account for whether you teach capstone projects, work with students from diverse backgrounds, manage compliance requirements, or work at an institution skeptical of AI. Context changes everything.\n\n\n6.4.2 2. Both Obvious and Non-Obvious Ideas\nAI tends to suggest obvious applications first. Those are valuable, but they’re predictable.\nBy asking for both obvious and non-obvious recommendations, you push AI to think more creatively:\nObvious: Use AI to generate discussion questions for your seminar Non-obvious: Use AI to analyse your students’ questions and assignments to identify common misconceptions, then address them proactively in lectures Non-obvious: Use AI to create assessment tasks that require authentic thinking (not just regurgitation) because they ask students to critique, improve, or apply AI-generated content Non-obvious: Use AI to help you understand your students’ diverse perspectives before class, so you can design more inclusive discussions\nThe non-obvious ideas are often where the real teaching value lies.\n\n\n6.4.3 3. Self-Evaluation and Refinement\nAI is remarkably good at evaluating its own suggestions. When it generates recommendations, it can: - Assess which are most feasible for your context - Identify trade-offs (e.g., “this saves you time but requires more tech setup”) - Refine implementation strategies based on your constraints - Suggest combinations or variations\nThis creates a feedback loop where recommendations get better through iteration.\n\n\n6.4.4 4. Collaborative Discovery\nUnlike reading a guide or taking a course, this is a conversation. You’re not passively receiving advice,you’re actively shaping it by: - Answering questions honestly about your actual context (not the ideal version) - Pushing back on ideas that don’t fit - Asking follow-up questions about implementation - Exploring implications for your students\nThe back-and-forth is where deep learning happens.",

Let’s start with the basics. What’s your primary teaching role? What discipline do you teach, and what level (undergraduate, postgraduate, both)?”\n\n\n\n6.5.3 You:\n\n“I teach financial analysis and audit in an undergraduate accounting program. I have 80-100 students across two cohorts, mostly domestic students who are serious about accounting careers.”\n\n\n\n6.5.4 AI’s Next Question:\n\n“That’s helpful. What’s your biggest teaching challenge right now? What’s most difficult about helping these students learn financial analysis and audit?”\n\n\n\n6.5.5 You:\n\n“They struggle to see why this matters beyond ‘passing the exam.’ They memorize procedures but don’t understand the judgment calls. And they’re terrified of making mistakes in analysis, so they don’t experiment or ask critical questions.”\n\n\n\n6.5.6 AI’s Next Question:\n\n“I understand. That’s about building professional judgment and confidence, not just knowledge. Now, how much time do you currently spend on things that feel routine or repetitive? What takes time away from the deeper teaching?”\n\n\n\n6.5.7 You:\n\n“A lot, honestly. Creating variations of practice problems, explaining the same audit concepts different ways to different students, writing feedback on assignments that often gives the same guidance repeatedly.”\n\n\n\n6.5.8 AI’s Next Question:\n\n“So you’re doing important work but some of it could be scaled. One more: What’s one thing you wish your students understood better about how professionals actually think about financial analysis?”\n\n\n\n6.5.9 You:\n\n“That audit is about judgment and risk, not just following a checklist. Real auditors have to decide what matters, what risks are significant, what’s worth investigating. That’s thinking, not just process.”\n\n\n\n6.5.10 AI’s Synthesis:\n\n“Okay, I have enough context. Here are my recommendations:\n\n\nOBVIOUS OPPORTUNITIES: - Use AI to generate variations of practice problems with different scenarios, then have students work through them - Use AI to explain audit concepts from multiple angles (visual, narrative, step-by-step) for different learners - Use AI to help provide consistent feedback on assignments at scale - Use AI to generate sample audit findings with explanations of the judgment involved\n\n\nNON-OBVIOUS OPPORTUNITIES: - Use AI as a ‘skeptical auditor’ to critique students’ audit plans before they execute them,teaching them to defend their judgments - Have students analyse AI-generated audit findings and critique whether the AI’s conclusions are justified,building professional judgment - Use AI to create complex, messy scenarios (like real audit situations) that don’t have obvious answers, then have students present their judgment and justify it - Use AI to help you identify patterns in student questions/mistakes, then design targeted interventions addressing the most common gaps - Create assessment tasks where students must improve, critique, or extend AI-generated audit analysis,this requires real thinking and can’t be done by just using AI”\n\n\nSee the difference? The AI didn’t just suggest “use AI for grading” or other generic ideas. It understood your specific discipline, your students’ needs, and your teaching philosophy. The recommendations are contextual and actionable.",

If you say “I only have 2 hours a week for this” or “My students are skeptical of AI” or “I don’t have technical skills,” that’s valuable context, not a weakness.\n\n\n6.9.2 Ask Follow-Up Questions\nAfter AI gives you recommendations, don’t just accept them. Ask: - “How would I actually implement the non-obvious ones in my classroom?” - “Which of these could I realistically start with this week?” - “What are the risks or drawbacks of each approach?” - “How would I know if this is actually working with my students?” - “How does this fit with my existing assessment structure?”\n\n\n6.9.3 Test One Obvious, One Non-Obvious\nAfter the consultation: 1. Pick ONE obvious recommendation and ONE non-obvious recommendation 2. Try each one with your students over a 2-3 week period 3. Pay attention to what happens: Do students engage differently? Does your work change? 4. Report back to the same conversation: “I tried [recommendation]. Here’s what happened…” 5. AI will help you iterate toward what works in your context\n\n\n6.9.4 Treat It as Ongoing\nThis isn’t a one-time conversation: - Your context changes; your teaching evolves - Student cohorts are different each year - Institutional requirements shift - Run this consultation again in 3–6 months - Each time you’ll be ready for different ideas\nDocument what you’ve tried and what’s working. When you re-run the consultation, share that history so AI understands your evolution.\n\n\n6.9.5 Share What You Learn\nIf you discover something useful, share it with colleagues: - “I asked AI to interview me about my teaching, and it suggested [X]. Here’s how it’s working…” - Others might try similar approaches - Collectively, your faculty learns what’s possible with AI in your discipline",

And very powerful.\n\nThe best tool for learning how to use AI is AI itself.\n\nThe discovery conversation you’re about to have with AI will teach you more about your own teaching than almost anything else. You’ll gain clarity about: - What you actually value in your teaching - What your students truly struggle with - Where your expertise lies (hint: nowhere an AI can replace you) - What’s possible when you leverage AI thoughtfully\nLean into that. Ask questions. Be honest about your context. Let AI surprise you with ideas you hadn’t considered.\nThat’s where the real value emerges.",

    "text": "7.3 Phase 2: Low-Stakes Student Introduction (First Month of Semester)\nYou’re now ready to introduce AI to students. Start with optional, low-stakes activities,not high-stakes assessments.\n\n7.3.1 Approach 1: Optional Practice Exercise\nWhat to do:\nIntroduce AI as a practice tool for an upcoming assignment.\nExample announcement to students,choose one from your discipline:\n\nBusiness & MarketingManagementHuman ResourcesTourism & HospitalitySupply Chain & LogisticsInformation SystemsAccounting & FinanceEconomics\n\n\n\n“For the competitive strategy assignment due in Week 8, I want to give you a chance to practice your analysis first. I’ve created an AI analysis prompt that you can use to check your draft positioning before submission. Write your draft, paste it into ChatGPT or Claude along with the critique prompt, and see what feedback you get. Then revise. This is optional,I won’t grade based on whether you used it. But you might find the market perspective helpful.”\n\n\n\n\n“For the change management plan due in Week 8, I want to give you practice feedback before submission. I’ve created an AI prompt that reviews your plan for stakeholder engagement and communication strategy. Write your draft, paste it with the prompt, and revise based on feedback. Completely optional, but it might help you think through stakeholder complexity.”\n\n\n\n\n“For the HR problem-solving assignment due in Week 8, I’ve created an AI prompt that provides preliminary feedback on your approach,whether you’ve identified compliance issues, considered employee perspective, and thought about equity. Write your draft, get AI feedback, revise. Optional, but students who use it usually score higher because they catch issues early.”\n\n\n\n\n“For the service management case study due in Week 8, I’ve created an AI prompt that critiques your proposed solution against service recovery principles. Write your draft, paste with the prompt, and see what gaps the AI identifies. Optional, but helpful for thinking through guest experience holistically.”\n\n\n\n\n“For the supply chain optimization problem due in Week 8, I’ve created an AI analysis prompt that reviews your solution for feasibility and trade-offs. Write your draft, get feedback on your constraints and assumptions, revise. Optional, but the feedback often identifies risks students miss.”\n\n\n\n\n“For the project plan due in Week 8, I’ve created an AI review prompt that evaluates your scope management and risk identification. Write your draft, paste with the prompt, and get preliminary feedback. Completely optional, but many students find it helps identify scope creep risks.”\n\n\n\n\n“For the financial analysis assignment due in Week 8, I’ve created an AI review prompt that checks your accounting treatment and valuation assumptions. Write your draft, get preliminary feedback, revise. Optional, but it’s good practice for thinking through judgment calls before final submission.”\n\n\n\n\n“For the policy recommendation due in Week 8, I’ve created an AI prompt that reviews your analysis for model assumptions and stakeholder considerations. Write your draft, get feedback on your reasoning, revise. Optional, but helpful for strengthening your economic argument.”\n\n\n\n\nWhy this works: - No pressure,students who are skeptical can ignore it - Students who try it will likely see value and spread the word to peers - You can gauge student response before making it mandatory - You avoid the “forced adoption” resistance\n\n\n7.3.2 Approach 2: In-Class Demonstration\nWhat to do:\nDuring a lecture, demonstrate AI in action as a teaching tool.\nDiscipline-specific live demonstrations:\n\nBusiness & MarketingManagementHuman ResourcesTourism & HospitalitySupply Chain & LogisticsInformation SystemsAccounting & FinanceEconomics\n\n\n\n“Today we’re learning about customer needs analysis. Let me show you something interesting. I’m going to ask an AI to role-play a demanding customer with objections, and I want you to watch and critique my sales approach.” Conduct a live negotiation with the AI projected on screen.\n\n\n\n\n“Today we’re learning about change leadership. I’m going to ask an AI to role-play a resistant employee, and I want you to watch and critique how I communicate the change.” Conduct a live conversation with the AI.\n\n\n\n\n“Today we’re learning about fair hiring practices. I’m going to ask an AI to role-play a candidate, and I want you to watch and critique my interview technique for bias.” Conduct a live interview with the AI projected.\n\n\n\n\n“Today we’re learning about service recovery. I’m going to ask an AI to role-play an upset guest, and I want you to watch and critique how I handle the complaint.” Conduct a live service interaction with the AI.\n\n\n\n\n“Today we’re learning about supply chain disruption response. I’m going to ask an AI to role-play a supplier with a major problem, and I want you to watch and critique my decision-making.” Conduct a live negotiation with the AI.\n\n\n\n\n“Today we’re learning about requirements gathering. I’m going to ask an AI to role-play a stakeholder with unclear needs, and I want you to watch and critique how I elicit requirements.” Conduct a live requirements session with the AI.\n\n\n\n\n“Today we’re learning about audit judgment. I’m going to ask an AI to role-play a questionable accounting treatment, and I want you to watch and critique my skepticism and analysis.” Conduct a live audit discussion with the AI.\n\n\n\n\n“Today we’re learning about economic policy analysis. I’m going to ask an AI to role-play a policymaker challenging my recommendation, and I want you to watch and critique my reasoning.” Conduct a live policy discussion with the AI.\n\n\n\n\nFollow-up: - Ask students: “What did I do well? What did I miss?” - Show how AI can provide a critique: paste the transcript into the critique prompt live - Discuss: “Did the AI catch the same things you did? Did it miss anything?”\nWhy this works: - Demystifies AI (students see it’s just a tool, not magic) - Models critical thinking about AI outputs - Shows your own willingness to be vulnerable and learn - Sparks curiosity about trying it themselves\n\n\n7.3.3 Approach 3: Reflective Exercise\nWhat to do:\nAssign a short, reflective writing task where students experiment with AI rather than complete a traditional assignment.\nDiscipline-specific reflection assignments:\n\nBusiness & MarketingManagementHuman ResourcesTourism & HospitalitySupply Chain & LogisticsInformation SystemsAccounting & FinanceEconomics\n\n\n\nAssignment: AI for Market Analysis (5% of grade) 1. Choose one market analysis skill we’ve covered (competitive analysis, customer segmentation, positioning strategy) 2. Use an AI tool to help you practice or analyse that skill 3. Write a 500-word reflection: What task did you ask AI to help with? What was useful? What was wrong or oversimplified? How would you use AI professionally?\n\n\n\n\nAssignment: AI for Organisational Analysis (5% of grade) 1. Choose one management skill we’ve covered (change analysis, stakeholder mapping, decision-making) 2. Use an AI tool to help you practice that skill 3. Write a 500-word reflection: What was useful about AI? What did AI miss about organisational complexity? How would you apply this professionally?\n\n\n\n\nAssignment: AI as an HR Tool (5% of grade) 1. Choose one HR skill we’ve covered (recruitment, performance management, employee relations) 2. Use an AI tool to help you practice that skill 3. Write a 500-word reflection: What was useful? What was wrong or risky about AI’s approach? How would you use AI responsibly as an HR professional?\n\n\n\n\nAssignment: AI for Service Management (5% of grade) 1. Choose one service skill we’ve covered (guest handling, service recovery, experience design) 2. Use an AI tool to help you practice that skill 3. Write a 500-word reflection: What did AI get right? What missed the human element of service? How would you use AI in hospitality?\n\n\n\n\nAssignment: AI for Supply Chain Analysis (5% of grade) 1. Choose one supply chain skill we’ve covered (demand forecasting, network design, disruption response) 2. Use an AI tool to help you practice that skill 3. Write a 500-word reflection: What was useful? What constraints did AI miss? How would you apply AI professionally?\n\n\n\n\nAssignment: AI for Systems Analysis (5% of grade) 1. Choose one IT skill we’ve covered (requirements gathering, project planning, risk analysis) 2. Use an AI tool to help you practice that skill 3. Write a 500-word reflection: What was useful? What was technically unrealistic? How would you use AI in IT practice?\n\n\n\n\nAssignment: AI for Financial Analysis (5% of grade) 1. Choose one accounting/finance skill we’ve covered (analysis, audit, valuation) 2. Use an AI tool to help you practice that skill 3. Write a 500-word reflection: What was useful? What was inaccurate or risky? How would you use AI professionally while maintaining standards?\n\n\n\n\nAssignment: AI for Economic Analysis (5% of grade) 1. Choose one economics skill we’ve covered (forecasting, policy analysis, modelling) 2. Use an AI tool to help you practice that skill 3. Write a 500-word reflection: What assumptions did AI make? What did it get wrong? How would you use AI in economic analysis professionally?\n\n\n\n\nGrading: You’re being graded on your critical reflection, not on the AI’s performance. Honest critique of AI’s limitations will score higher than uncritical praise.\nWhy this works: - Low stakes (only 5% of grade) - Emphasizes critical thinking about AI rather than reliance on AI - Introduces AI literacy as a learning objective - Gives you insight into how students are using AI",

    "text": "7.4 Phase 3: Pilot Assessment (Mid-Semester)\nAfter students have some familiarity with AI, introduce one AI-enhanced assessment. Choose something meaningful but not the highest-stakes assignment.\n\n7.4.1 Implementation Checklist\nBefore you launch:\n\nYou’ve tested the prompts yourself thoroughly\nYou’ve created clear student instructions (what to do, how to do it, what’s expected)\nYou’ve prepared a FAQ document anticipating student questions\nYou’ve decided how much this is worth (recommend 15-25% of final grade for first pilot)\nYou’ve built in time for technical issues (some students will need help accessing AI tools)\n\nChoose your model:\nBased on Chapters 4-7, select one approach for a single assignment:\nOption A: Conversation Simulation + Reflection (Chapter 4) - Lower workload for grading - Students are most likely to find this engaging - Easiest to explain\nOption B: Self-Assessment with Transparency Model (Chapter 5) - Works for existing essay/case study assignments - Minimal restructuring needed - Good introduction to AI literacy\nOption C: AI Critique and Override (Chapter 7, Model 3) - Medium complexity - Strong focus on critical thinking - Clear demonstration of learning\nDon’t choose: Virtual company simulation (Chapter 6) or complex multi-part process assessment (Chapter 7, Models 1-2) for your first pilot. Save those for when you have more experience.\n\nThinking bigger than a single assignment?\nIf you’re ready to redesign an entire unit from the ground up rather than piloting a single assignment, see Chapter 10: Designing an AI-Integrated Unit for a complete backwards design framework. That chapter shows how to: - Map AI integration across a full 12-week semester - Build scaffolded progression from Week 1 to Week 12 - Balance AI-enhanced and traditional learning activities - Support student AI literacy development throughout the unit\nMost lecturers should start with a single assignment pilot before attempting whole-unit redesign. Once you’ve successfully piloted one AI-enhanced assignment and gathered student feedback, you’ll be in a much stronger position to expand your approach across an entire unit.\n\n\n7.4.2 Launch Week: Student Orientation\nDedicate 15-20 minutes of class time to:\n\nExplain the “why”,discipline-specific language:\n\n\nBusiness & MarketingManagementHuman ResourcesTourism & HospitalitySupply Chain & LogisticsInformation SystemsAccounting & FinanceEconomics\n\n\n\n“We’re trying something new because I want you to practice real business skills,customer analysis, persuasion, strategy,not just write about them. In professional marketing, you’ll use AI for analysis and insights, so learning to use AI critically is part of your education.”\n\n\n\n\n“We’re trying something new because I want you to practice real management challenges,stakeholder navigation, change communication, decision-making,not just theorize about them. Managers use AI for analysis and planning, so learning to use it critically matters.”\n\n\n\n\n“We’re trying something new because I want you to practice actual HR skills,interviewing, problem-solving, fair judgment,not just describe processes. In HR work, you’ll use AI tools, so learning to use them responsibly is part of your professional practice.”\n\n\n\n\n“We’re trying something new because I want you to practice real service scenarios,guest handling, recovery, experience design,not just learn theory. In hospitality management, you’ll use AI for operations and guests, so understanding it critically matters.”\n\n\n\n\n“We’re trying something new because I want you to practice actual supply chain decisions,under uncertainty, with constraints, with real consequences,not just solve textbook problems. Supply chain professionals use AI for forecasting and optimization, so learning to use it critically is essential.”\n\n\n\n\n“We’re trying something new because I want you to practice real IT challenges,requirements, scope management, technical trade-offs,not just memorize methodology. IT professionals use AI extensively, so learning to use it critically for code and analysis is part of your skill set.”\n\n\n\n\n“We’re trying something new because I want you to practice real accounting judgment,analysis, professional skepticism, complex treatment decisions,not just follow rules. Finance professionals use AI for analysis, so learning to use it critically while maintaining standards is important.”\n\n\n\n\n“We’re trying something new because I want you to practice real economic analysis,policy reasoning, modelling, evidence evaluation,not just recite theory. Economists use AI for research and analysis, so learning to use it critically for your work is essential.”\n\n\n\n\n\nAddress the anxiety &gt; “Some of you might be worried this is too technical,it’s not. If you can copy and paste text, you can do this assignment. Some of you might be thinking this makes things easier,actually, it makes things harder, because I’m assessing your thinking process and professional judgment, not just your final answer.”\nDo a live demo\n\nShow exactly how to access the AI tool\nShow exactly how to paste the prompt\nShow exactly what happens next\nShow what they submit to you\n\nOpen for questions\nProvide written instructions\n\nCreate a one-page step-by-step guide students can refer back to\nInclude screenshots if needed\nProvide a technical support contact (could be you, a TA, or IT support)\n\n\n\n\n7.4.3 During the Assignment Period: Be Available\nCommon student issues:\n“The AI isn’t staying in character” → Response: Check that you copied the full prompt. Try starting a fresh conversation.\n“The AI gave me weird feedback” → Response: That’s possible,AI can make errors. In your reflection, explain what the AI got wrong and why. You’ll get credit for catching the error.\n“I don’t have access to ChatGPT” → Response: Try Claude.ai instead, or come to office hours and we can run it together.\n“Is this even allowed? Am I cheating?” → Response: Yes, it’s allowed,this is the assignment. You’re being graded on your critical use of AI, not on avoiding it.\n\n\n7.4.4 After Submission: Grading Efficiently\nCreate a grading workflow:\n\nQuick initial scan (5 minutes per student)\n\nDid they follow instructions?\nDid they submit all required components?\nAny obvious red flags (e.g., obviously didn’t do the work)?\n\nDeep assessment (15-20 minutes per student)\n\nReview the transcript/analysis/reflection against your rubric\nLook for evidence of learning and critical thinking\nProvide targeted feedback (2-3 specific comments)\n\nUse standard comment banks\n\nCreate a document with common feedback phrases you can copy-paste\nExamples: “Strong application of procedural fairness here,” “This needed more specific evidence from the transcript,” “Excellent critique of AI’s oversight”\n\n\nTime-saving tip: Use AI itself to help with initial feedback:\nYour prompt to AI,discipline-specific version:\n\nBusiness & MarketingManagementHuman ResourcesTourism & HospitalitySupply Chain & LogisticsInformation SystemsAccounting & FinanceEconomics\n\n\nYou are assisting with grading market strategy assignments.

But in marketing work, you’ll use AI tools for analysis, forecasting, and customer insights. My job is to prepare you for professional practice, and that now includes knowing when and how to use AI responsibly for market work. You don’t need to become an AI expert,just a critical user.”\n\n\n\n\n“I understand this is different. But in management, you’ll use AI for organisational analysis and decision support. My job is to prepare you for professional practice where AI is a standard tool. I’m not asking you to become a tech expert,just to understand AI’s role in organisational work.”\n\n\n\n\n“I understand this is different. But in HR work, you’ll use AI tools in recruitment, analytics, and decision support. My job is to prepare you for professional practice, and that includes knowing when and how to use AI responsibly. You don’t become an AI expert,just a critical, ethical user.”\n\n\n\n\n“I understand this is different. But in hospitality management, you’ll use AI for operations and guest analytics. My job is to prepare you for professional practice where AI is increasingly common. I’m not asking you to become tech-savvy,just to understand AI’s role critically.”\n\n\n\n\n“I understand this is different. But in supply chain work, you’ll use AI for forecasting, optimization, and network analysis. My job is to prepare you for professional practice in an AI-enabled environment. You don’t need to be a data scientist,just know how to use and evaluate AI tools.”\n\n\n\n\n“I understand this is different. But IT professionals use AI extensively for code, analysis, and systems work. My job is to prepare you for professional practice where AI literacy is essential. You don’t need to become a machine learning expert,just know how to use AI tools critically.”\n\n\n\n\n“I understand this is different. But finance professionals use AI for analysis, forecasting, and risk assessment. My job is to prepare you for professional practice where AI tools are standard. You don’t need to be a programmer,just know how to use and validate AI outputs.”\n\n\n\n\n“I understand this is different. But economists use AI for research, forecasting, and policy analysis. My job is to prepare you for professional practice in an AI-integrated field. You don’t need to be a computer scientist,just a critical user of AI tools.”\n\n\n\n\n“I don’t trust AI / I think AI is unethical”\nResponse: &gt; “That’s actually a valuable perspective. This assignment is a chance for you to critically evaluate AI’s limitations and biases in your field. Students who identify what AI gets wrong often score highest, because that demonstrates critical thinking. You don’t have to like AI,you just need to understand it and use it responsibly.”\n\n\n7.7.2 Challenge 2: Resistance from Colleagues\n“You’re just making things easier for students”\nResponse: &gt; “Actually, it’s harder,students can’t just memorize and regurgitate anymore. They have to think critically and demonstrate process. The AI doesn’t give them answers; it creates dynamic challenges they have to navigate.”\n“AI feedback isn’t as good as human feedback”\nResponse: &gt; “You’re right,that’s why I’m still grading the final work. But AI feedback is instant and available 24/7. Students can practice and revise multiple times before submission. That’s pedagogically valuable even if AI feedback isn’t perfect.”\n“What about academic integrity?”\nResponse: &gt; “This approach actually makes cheating harder. I’m assessing their process and critical thinking, not just final answers. And by teaching students to use AI transparently, I’m building integrity rather than policing violations.”\n\n\n7.7.3 Challenge 3: Technology Failures\n“The AI platform was down during the assignment period”\nStudents affected: Build in flexibility,allow extensions or alternative submission methods if technical issues occur.\nPrevention: Provide multiple AI tool options (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.) so students have backups.\n\n\n7.7.4 Challenge 4: Uneven Student Access\n“Some students don’t have reliable internet or devices”\nSolutions: - Provide lab time where students can complete the assignment on campus - Offer office hours where you can facilitate the AI interaction together - Check if your university has institutional AI tool subscriptions - Design assignments that can be completed in short sessions (don’t require hours of continuous AI access)\n\n\n7.7.5 Challenge 5: You’re Overwhelmed\n“This is taking more time than expected and I’m drowning”\nEmergency strategies: - Reduce the weight of the AI assignment (make it formative, not summative) - Make reflection/analysis shorter (250 words instead of 500) - Grade on completion rather than detailed quality for this first round - Ask for teaching assistant support if available - Remember: It gets easier the second time\nLong-term: Building AI-enhanced assignments is front-loaded work. Year 1 is significant effort. Year 2 is refinement. Year 3 is almost autopilot.",

You don’t need to be perfect. You just need to start.\nYour first AI-enhanced assignment will be imperfect. Do it anyway.\nYou’ll discover what works in your context, with your students, for your content. Every lecturer’s implementation will look slightly different,and that’s exactly right.\nThe chapters before this showed you what’s possible. This chapter showed you how to make it real.\nNow it’s time to choose your first small experiment and try it.\n\nNext Chapter Preview: In Chapter 9, we directly address the academic integrity and ethics question. You’ll learn how to talk to students about AI use, how to design assignments that minimise misuse while maximizing learning, and how to reframe “preventing AI cheating” as “teaching AI literacy and professional ethics.” This is the conversation you’ll need to have with students, colleagues, and possibly administrators.",

    "text": "8.2 Technique 1: Reverse Prompting (for Scoping and Policy Design)\n\n8.2.1 What It Does\nInstead of the student immediately solving a problem, the AI asks them questions to help scope out all the requirements, considerations, and potential issues. This mirrors real HR work, where defining the problem properly is half the battle.\n\n\n8.2.2 Why It Works Across Disciplines\nComplex problem scoping is fundamental to all business disciplines. Whether designing policies, strategies, systems, or solutions, professionals must think through multiple stakeholders, constraints, legal/ethical implications, and trade-offs. This technique forces students to move beyond obvious surface issues and consider the full complexity before starting to solve.\nDiscipline-specific contexts: - HR: Policy and program design with stakeholder, legal, operational, and fairness considerations - Business/Marketing: Strategy development with market, competitive, financial, and capability considerations - Management: Organisational change with stakeholder, cultural, operational, and risk considerations - Supply Chain: Network design with cost, resilience, sustainability, and operational considerations - Accounting/Finance: Audit or valuation scope with compliance, materiality, and stakeholder considerations - Economics: Policy design with trade-offs, stakeholder impacts, and evidence considerations\n\n\n8.2.3 The Student Prompt (Ready to Use)\nI need to draft a new \"Flexible Work Arrangement\" policy for a 500-employee\ncompany that has both office-based and remote staff. I need to make sure I\ncover all the key areas.\n\nYour task: Ask me a series of yes/no or short-answer questions to help me\nclarify all the requirements, considerations, and potential pitfalls for\nthis policy.\n\nAsk one question at a time. Wait for my response before asking the next\nquestion. Continue until you've helped me think through at least 10\ndifferent aspects of this policy.\n\nBegin with your first question.\n\n\n8.2.4 What Happens\nThe AI will start asking questions like:\n\n“Will all roles be eligible for flexible arrangements, or will there be specific criteria?”\n“Have you considered how this will affect team collaboration and meeting schedules?”\n“What equipment or technology support will the company provide for remote workers?”\n“How will you handle performance measurement for remote versus office staff?”\n“Are there legal or insurance implications you need to address?”\n\nThe student must think through each question before responding. By the end, they’ve been guided to consider fairness, logistics, legal compliance, technology needs, and cultural impact,all before drafting a single policy sentence.\n\n\n8.2.5 Variations for Different Disciplines\n\nHRBusiness & MarketingManagementSupply Chain & LogisticsInformation SystemsAccounting & FinanceEconomics\n\n\n\n“I need to design an onboarding program for graduate hires.

    "text": "8.3 Technique 2: Pros and Cons (for Decision Making)\n\n8.3.1 What It Does\nThe AI systematically analyses multiple approaches to a business problem, evaluating each option against specific criteria. This develops the ability to make justified recommendations rather than just stating preferences.\n\n\n8.3.2 Why It Works Across Disciplines\nAll business professionals must evaluate competing strategies and make balanced, evidence-based recommendations. This technique builds the muscle for weighing trade-offs, considering multiple stakeholder perspectives, and justifying strategic choices.\n\n\n8.3.3 The Student Prompt (Ready to Use)\nWhat are the main models for conducting performance reviews in a hybrid\nworkforce? For each model you identify, provide:\n\n1. A brief description of how it works\n2. Three key advantages\n3. Three key disadvantages\n\nEvaluate each model specifically in terms of:\n- Fairness and perceived equity\n- Administrative overhead and manager workload\n- Impact on employee morale and development\n\nConclude with a recommendation for which model would be most appropriate\nfor a mid-sized tech company (300 employees, 60% hybrid, 40% fully remote)\nand justify your recommendation.\n\n\n8.3.4 What Happens\nThe AI will identify 3-4 performance review models (e.g., annual reviews, continuous feedback, 360-degree feedback, OKR-based systems) and analyse each systematically. The student receives a structured comparison that they must then critically evaluate.\n\n\n8.3.5 The Follow-Up Task\nDon’t let students simply accept the AI’s recommendation. Require them to:\n\nChallenge one of the “pros” listed,is it really an advantage in all contexts?\nAdd a disadvantage the AI missed\nArgue for a different model than the AI recommended, using evidence\nIdentify which psychological or motivational theory supports or contradicts each approach\n\nThis transforms the AI output from an answer into a starting point for deeper analysis.\n\n\n8.3.6 Variations for Different Disciplines\n\nHRBusiness & MarketingManagementSupply Chain & LogisticsInformation SystemsAccounting & FinanceEconomics\n\n\n\n“Compare different approaches to managing workplace conflict: mediation, formal grievance process, restorative justice. Evaluate each for speed, fairness, and relationship preservation.”\n“Analyze three different redundancy selection methods. What are the legal risks and ethical considerations of each?”\n“What are the pros and cons of using AI-powered resume screening tools versus traditional human review?”\n\n\n\n\n“Compare different market entry strategies: direct investment, partnership, acquisition. Evaluate each for speed to market, cost, risk, and control.”\n“Analyze different pricing strategies: penetration pricing, value-based pricing, competitive pricing. What are the trade-offs for market share, profitability, and customer perception?”\n“What are the pros and cons of expanding through new products versus new markets?”\n\n\n\n\n“Compare different organisational structures: functional, divisional, matrix, networked. Evaluate each for agility, accountability, and collaboration.”\n“Analyze different change management approaches: top-down, participative, emergent. What are the trade-offs for speed, buy-in, and sustainability?”\n“What are the pros and cons of different leadership models: directive, participative, delegative?”\n\n\n\n\n“Compare different supply chain strategies: make-to-stock, make-to-order, mass customization.

    "text": "8.4 Technique 3: Stepwise Chain of Thought (for Process Management)\n\n8.4.1 What It Does\nThe AI walks through a complex business process one step at a time, pausing after each step until the student signals they’re ready to continue. This slows down high-stakes processes that students often rush through.\n\n\n8.4.2 Why It Works Across Disciplines\nMany professional processes are legally, ethically, or operationally sensitive. Students need to understand why each step exists and what considerations apply at that stage. This technique forces deliberate, sequential thinking and deep engagement with process logic.\n\n\n8.4.3 The Student Prompt (Ready to Use)\nI am learning how to properly conduct a disciplinary action process for an\nemployee with a pattern of repeated lateness.\n\nYour task: Walk me through the entire disciplinary process, starting from\nthe very first informal conversation. For each step, tell me:\n\n1. What action to take\n2. What to document\n3. What legal or procedural consideration is important at this stage\n\nAfter you explain each step, STOP and wait for me to type \"next\" before\nmoving to the next step. Do not provide the entire process at once.\n\nBegin with Step 1.\n\n\n8.4.4 What Happens\nThe AI will provide the first step:\n\nStep 1: Informal Verbal Warning\nAction: Meet privately with the employee to discuss the lateness pattern. Use a calm, non-accusatory tone. Ask if there are any circumstances contributing to the issue (e.g., transport problems, personal issues, health concerns).\nDocumentation: Make a brief file note recording the date, what was discussed, and the employee’s response. This is informal, so no formal warning letter yet.\nLegal/Procedural Consideration: At this stage, you’re gathering information and providing an opportunity for the employee to explain. Under principles of procedural fairness, you must give them a chance to be heard before escalating.\nType “next” when you’re ready for Step 2.\n\nThe student must actively engage with each step before progressing. This prevents them from skipping to “just fire them” without understanding the required process.\n\n\n8.4.5 Variations for Different Disciplines\n\nHRBusiness & MarketingManagementSupply Chain & LogisticsInformation SystemsAccounting & FinanceEconomics\n\n\n\n“Walk me through conducting a workplace investigation into a bullying complaint.

Pause after each phase.”\n“Show me the capital budgeting process step by step, from proposal through post-implementation review.”\n\n\n\n\n“Walk me through conducting an economic impact analysis. Explain each step and the assumptions involved.”\n“Take me through developing a policy recommendation. Pause after each step to explain the reasoning.”\n“Show me how to construct an economic model from theory through validation. One step at a time.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.4.6 Teaching Tip\nThis is excellent for individual revision or exam prep. Students can practice the process multiple times, and each time they can ask the AI to introduce complications: “In Step 3, what if the employee refuses to sign the written warning?” The AI will explain how to handle variations.\nYou can also use this to generate assessment materials: Have the AI walk through a process, then you create an exam question where one of the steps was done incorrectly and students must identify the error and its consequences.",

    "section": "8.5 Technique 4: Role Play (for Skill Building)",
    "text": "8.5 Technique 4: Role Play (for Skill Building)\n\n8.5.1 What It Does\nThe AI adopts a specific persona and engages in a realistic conversation with the student. This is the “flight simulator” concept in action.\n\n\n8.5.2 Why It Works Across Disciplines\nBusiness work is fundamentally about interaction,with clients, stakeholders, teams, and colleagues. Students can memorize theory, but until they practice actually having difficult conversations where others push back, get emotional, or raise objections, they won’t develop genuine interpersonal competence.\n\n\n8.5.3 The Student Prompt (Ready to Use)\nYou are an experienced and empathetic HR Business Partner. I am a new,\nnervous manager who needs to put one of my team members on a Performance\nImprovement Plan (PIP).\n\nYour goal is to coach me through preparing for and conducting this meeting\nsuccessfully.\n\nGuide me through this step by step:\n1. First, ask me why the employee is being put on a PIP\n2. Wait for my answer\n3. If my answer is vague or subjective (e.g., \"bad attitude\"), challenge me\n   gently and ask me to be more specific and behavioural\n4. Once I give you a solid answer, move to the next aspect: helping me\n   draft clear, measurable objectives for the PIP\n5. Continue coaching me through each element of the conversation I need to\n   have with the employee\n\nThroughout this process, if I say something that could be problematic\n(legally risky, unfair, too harsh, or too vague), pause and give me\nfeedback on how to improve it.\n\nBegin by asking me your first question.\n\n\n8.5.4 What Happens\nThe AI becomes a coach who actively guides the student through preparation. If the student says “I’m putting them on a PIP because they’re lazy,” the AI will respond:\n\n“I understand you’re frustrated, but ‘lazy’ is subjective and not something we can measure or document defensibly. Let’s try again: what specific behaviours or performance gaps have you observed? For example, are they missing deadlines, producing work below the required standard, or not completing their assigned tasks?”\n\nThis iterative coaching helps students learn to think and speak like HR professionals.\n\n\n8.5.5 Advanced Variation: The Difficult Conversation\nOnce students are comfortable, flip the scenario:\nYou are Sarah, a high-performing marketing manager who has just been told\nyou're being put on a Performance Improvement Plan. You are shocked,\ndefensive, and angry because you believe this is unfair and politically\nmotivated.\n\nI am the HR representative who has to conduct this PIP meeting with you.\n\nYour behaviour:\n- Start the conversation by immediately challenging the fairness of the PIP\n- Bring up a recent successful project you led\n- Hint that you believe this is retaliation for raising a complaint about\n  your manager last month\n- Be emotional but not abusive—show genuine distress\n\nI will attempt to conduct this meeting professionally. Stay in character\nuntil I manage to de-escalate the situation and establish a constructive\ndialogue.\n\nBegin the meeting. I will speak first.\nNow the student has to manage a realistic, emotionally charged scenario. They must practice de-escalation, empathy, procedural fairness, and documentation,all while the AI responds dynamically to what they say.\n\n\n8.5.6 Variations for Different Disciplines\n\nHRBusiness & MarketingManagementSupply Chain & LogisticsInformation SystemsAccounting & FinanceEconomics\n\n\n\nAI plays a union representative in an enterprise bargaining negotiation\nAI plays a candidate in a behavioural interview who gives weak answers that need probing\nAI plays a manager who resists implementing a diversity initiative\nAI plays an employee making an informal discrimination complaint\n\n\n\n\nAI plays a difficult customer objecting to pricing and demanding better terms\nAI plays a competitor in a market negotiation\nAI plays a skeptical internal stakeholder who needs to be convinced of a strategy\nAI plays a partner company executive in a partnership negotiation\n\n\n\n\nAI plays an employee resistant to organisational change\nAI plays a union representative in a labour negotiation\nAI plays a direct report who is underperforming and defensive\nAI plays a peer manager with competing priorities\n\n\n\n\nAI plays a demanding supplier or customer\nAI plays an internal stakeholder questioning cost cuts\nAI plays a logistics partner with implementation concerns\nAI plays a regulator questioning compliance\n\n\n\n\nAI plays a resistant end-user during system implementation\nAI plays a business stakeholder with changing requirements\nAI plays a project team member questioning a technical decision\nAI plays a vendor in a software licensing negotiation\n\n\n\n\nAI plays a client questioning an audit finding\nAI plays a board member scrutinizing a financial decision\nAI plays an internal stakeholder challenging a budget proposal\nAI plays a regulator questioning financial reporting\n\n\n\n\nAI plays a policymaker questioning an economic recommendation\nAI plays a stakeholder affected by proposed policy\nAI plays a peer economist with a competing analysis\nAI plays a business leader concerned about economic impacts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.5.7 Teaching Tip\nAssessment approach: Require students to submit the full transcript of the conversation along with a reflective analysis answering:\n\nWhat communication techniques did you use?\nWhere did the conversation go well or poorly?\nWhat would you do differently next time?\nWhat HR theory or legal principle guided your approach?\n\nThis makes the process visible and assessable.",

    "section": "8.6 Technique 5: Debating (for Strategic and Ethical Analysis)",
    "text": "8.6 Technique 5: Debating (for Strategic and Ethical Analysis)\n\n8.6.1 What It Does\nThe AI examines multiple perspectives on a contentious issue, argues for and against different positions, and helps students see the complexity and trade-offs in strategic decisions.\n\n\n8.6.2 Why It Works Across Disciplines\nModern business work exists in gray areas where competing legitimate perspectives exist. Whether addressing HR challenges, business strategy, operational trade-offs, financial decisions, or policy questions, professionals need to develop the ability to argue multiple sides of an issue before making a defensible recommendation.\n\n\n8.6.3 Variation A: Critique and Compare\nI will provide you with two different \"Bring Your Own Device (BYOD)\"\npolicies from two fictional companies.\n\nYour task:\n1. Critique the strengths and weaknesses of each policy in terms of\n   security, employee privacy, and clarity\n2. Tell me which policy is stronger overall and why\n3. Identify one element from the weaker policy that could improve the\n   stronger one\n\nHere is Policy A: [paste policy]\nHere is Policy B: [paste policy]\n\nBegin your analysis.\nTeaching use: You draft two policies (or have the AI generate them), one deliberately flawed. Students must identify which is better and justify their reasoning. This develops critical evaluation skills.\n\n\n8.6.4 Variation B: Argue Both Sides\nI want you to debate the pros and cons of using AI-powered tools to scan\nresumes and filter job applicants.\n\nStructure your response in three parts:\n\n**Part 1: The Case FOR Using AI Resume Screening**\nMake the strongest possible argument in favour of this technology. Consider\nefficiency, consistency, potential to reduce human bias, cost savings, and\nscalability.\n\n**Part 2: The Case AGAINST Using AI Resume Screening**\nMake the strongest possible argument against this technology. Consider\nalgorithmic bias, legal risk, lack of contextual understanding, potential\ndiscrimination, and dehumanization of the recruitment process.\n\n**Part 3: Critical Synthesis**\nCritique both arguments you just made. What did each side get right? What\ndid each side oversimplify or ignore? Provide a balanced recommendation\nwith conditions (e.g., \"Use AI screening only if X, Y, and Z safeguards\nare in place\").\nWhat Happens: The AI will construct sophisticated arguments for both positions, then provide a nuanced synthesis. Students can’t just pick a side,they have to understand the legitimate concerns and benefits on both sides.\n\n\n8.6.5 Variation C: Multi-Stakeholder Debate\nThis is the most sophisticated version:\nYou will simulate a leadership debate on whether to implement a \"mandatory\nreturn to office\" policy requiring all employees to work in-office four\ndays per week.\n\nCreate three distinct personas and have them debate this issue:\n\n**Persona 1: The CFO (Chief Financial Officer)**\nFocus on: Real estate costs, productivity metrics, and financial efficiency\n\n**Persona 2: The CHRO (Chief HR Officer)**\nFocus on: Employee morale, retention, recruitment competitiveness, and\ndiversity/equity/inclusion implications\n\n**Persona 3: The COO (Chief Operating Officer)**\nFocus on: Team collaboration, operational consistency, training\neffectiveness, and company culture\n\nHave each persona make their opening argument (3-4 sentences each). Then\nhave them respond to each other's points. Continue the debate through three\nrounds until they need to make a recommendation to the CEO.\n\nAfter the debate, summarize the key tension points and what a compromise\npolicy might look like.\n\nBegin the debate.\nWhat Happens: The AI will create a realistic executive debate where each stakeholder has legitimate but competing priorities. Students see that there’s rarely a perfect answer,only trade-offs and compromise.\n\n\n8.6.6 Follow-Up Task for Students\nAfter reading the debate, students must: 1. Identify which stakeholder made the strongest argument and why 2. Propose a policy that addresses the COO’s concerns while minimising the CHRO’s risks 3. Explain what data or evidence would help resolve the CFO’s questions 4. Reflect on which psychological or organisational theory best explains the tension between these perspectives\n\n\n8.6.7 Teaching Tip\nThis technique is perfect for preparing students for case study exams. Instead of memorizing model answers, they practice analysing competing priorities and justifying nuanced positions,exactly what they’ll need to do in professional practice.",

    "section": "8.7 Technique 6: Formative Assessment Generator (for Practice and Mastery)",
    "text": "8.7 Technique 6: Formative Assessment Generator (for Practice and Mastery)\n\n8.7.1 What It Does\nThe AI generates unlimited practice questions, scenarios, or quizzes that students can use to test their knowledge and build confidence. This provides low-stakes repetition and immediate feedback,essential for skill development.\n\n\n8.7.2 Why It Works for HR\nMany HR competencies require both knowledge (legislation, theory) and application (recognizing situations where that knowledge applies). Students need more practice than traditional homework provides, but creating dozens of unique practice scenarios is time-prohibitive for lecturers. AI solves this.\n\n\n8.7.3 Use Case 1: Self-Testing Knowledge\nStudent Prompt:\nI'm studying for an exam on Australian employment law. I need to practice\nidentifying which legislation applies in different workplace scenarios.\n\nGenerate 10 short scenario descriptions (2-3 sentences each) where I need\nto identify:\n1. Which legislation is relevant (e.g., Fair Work Act, WHS Act,\n   Anti-Discrimination Act)\n2. What the employer's legal obligation is\n3. What risk exists if the employer doesn't comply\n\nAfter I answer each one, tell me if I'm correct and explain why.\n\nBegin with Scenario 1.\nWhat Happens: The AI creates scenario after scenario. Students test themselves, get immediate feedback, and can continue until they achieve mastery. Unlike a textbook with 5 practice problems, this provides unlimited practice.\nKey feature: AI adapts. If student gets several wrong, AI can simplify. If student masters basic scenarios, AI can make them more complex.\n\n\n\n8.7.4 Use Case 2: Application Practice\nStudent Prompt:\nI'm learning to identify different types of workplace conflict (task\nconflict, relationship conflict, process conflict).\n\nCreate 8 brief workplace scenarios. For each one, I'll identify the type\nof conflict and suggest an appropriate intervention approach.\n\nAfter each scenario, provide feedback on my classification and intervention\nsuggestion. If I'm wrong, explain why and what I missed.\n\nMake the scenarios progressively more complex—start easy, end with\nambiguous situations where multiple interpretations are valid.\n\nBegin with Scenario 1.\nWhat Happens: Progressive difficulty builds confidence and competence. Students move from obvious cases to nuanced judgment calls.\n\n\n\n8.7.5 Use Case 3: Exam Preparation\nStudent Prompt:\nCreate a practice exam for me based on the topics we've covered in my\nWorkplace Conflict Resolution unit.\n\nInclude:\n- 10 multiple choice questions (4 options each)\n- 3 short-answer questions (each requiring 150-200 word response)\n- 1 case study with 4 analysis questions\n\nTopics to cover:\n- Conflict theory (Thomas-Kilmann, interest-based bargaining)\n- Investigation processes\n- Mediation approaches\n- Legal requirements (procedural fairness, natural justice)\n\nAfter I complete the exam, grade my answers and provide detailed feedback\non what I got right/wrong and why.\nWhat Happens: Students can generate multiple practice exams with different questions each time. They enter the real exam having practiced extensively.\n\n\n\n8.7.6 Use Case 4: Targeted Remediation\nLecturer Prompt (to create remediation resource):\nI have students who struggled with understanding procedural fairness in\nworkplace investigations. Many think it just means \"being nice\" and don't\nunderstand the specific legal requirements.\n\nCreate a 10-question diagnostic quiz that tests whether students understand:\n1. The right to be informed of allegations\n2. The right to respond to allegations\n3. The requirement for impartial decision-making\n4. The requirement to consider the response before deciding\n5. The right to representation/support\n\nFor each question, use a scenario format. After each answer, provide\nimmediate teaching feedback explaining the principle, not just whether\nthey're right or wrong.\n\nGenerate the quiz.\nWhat You Get: A targeted remediation tool that teaches while testing. Students who failed your assessment can use this to identify and fix their knowledge gaps.\n\n\n\n8.7.7 Teaching Tip: How to Integrate This\nOption 1: Recommended Practice (Ungraded)\nIn your unit outline: &gt; “Before each assessment, I recommend using AI to generate practice questions and scenarios. Spend 30-60 minutes testing yourself until you feel confident. This is optional but strongly encouraged.”\nOption 2: Required Pre-Assessment Activity (Low Stakes)\n\n“Before the Week 8 exam, complete a self-generated practice test (minimum 20 questions). Submit a screenshot showing completion and a 100-word reflection: What did you learn from this practice? What areas do you still need to review?”\n\nWorth 5% of final grade,graded on completion and reflection quality, not on how many they got right.\nOption 3: Study Group Activity\n\n“In your study groups, use AI to generate practice scenarios. Each person generates 5 scenarios and tests the group. Discuss answers and explanations together.”\n\nCombines AI efficiency with peer learning.\n\n\n\n8.7.8 Critical Principle: Formative, Not Summative\nImportant: This technique is for practice, not for graded assessment.\nWhy? - Students can regenerate until they get “good” questions they already know answers to - AI-generated questions lack the rigor of carefully designed exam questions - Students need to struggle and make mistakes in low-stakes practice\nThe value: Unlimited, personalised practice that builds confidence and competence before high-stakes assessment.\n\n\n\n8.7.9 Variation: Adaptive Difficulty\nAdvanced Student Prompt:\nI want to practice identifying workplace bullying vs. performance management\nvs. legitimate reasonable management action.\n\nCreate scenarios for me to classify. After each one:\n- If I get it right, make the next scenario more nuanced and ambiguous\n- If I get it wrong, make the next scenario clearer and more obvious\n- Continue until I can correctly identify 5 difficult/ambiguous cases in a row\n\nTrack my progress and tell me when I've achieved mastery.\n\nBegin.\nThis creates a personalised learning path,AI adjusts difficulty based on student performance.\n\n\n\n8.7.10 Why This Matters\nTraditional practice is limited by: - Finite textbook questions - Lecturer time to create practice materials - Inability to provide immediate feedback at scale\nAI removes these constraints: - Infinite practice scenarios - Instant generation - Immediate feedback - Adaptive difficulty\nResult: Students can practice until they achieve mastery, not until they run out of practice problems.\n\n\n\n8.7.11 Simulating Adaptive Difficulty\nWhile true adaptive AI systems require technical infrastructure, students can manually create adaptive difficulty through smart prompting:\nStudent Prompt: Self-Directed Progression\nI want to practice identifying workplace bullying vs. legitimate performance\nmanagement vs. reasonable management action.\n\nGenerate scenarios for me to classify. After I answer each one, tell me if\nI'm correct.\n\nTrack my performance. When I get 8 out of 10 correct, automatically make\nthe next batch of scenarios more complex and ambiguous. When I get fewer\nthan 5 out of 10 correct, make the next batch clearer and more obvious.\n\nContinue until I can correctly identify 5 difficult, ambiguous cases in a row.\n\nBegin with Scenario 1 at medium difficulty.\nWhat This Achieves: - Student-controlled difficulty progression - Mastery-based advancement - Builds confidence through appropriate challenge - No technical setup required,just good prompting\nTeaching Tip:\nEncourage students to track their progress: &gt; “Before your next exam, use AI to practice until you achieve 90% accuracy on hard scenarios. Submit a screenshot showing your progression and a 100-word reflection on what you learned.”\nThis creates accountability without requiring sophisticated adaptive systems.",

    "section": "8.8 Technique 7: The Expert Panel (for Multi-Perspective Analysis)",
    "text": "8.8 Technique 7: The Expert Panel (for Multi-Perspective Analysis)\n\n8.8.1 What It Does\nStudents consult multiple AI “experts” with different theoretical or professional perspectives on the same HR problem, then synthesize the competing advice into a strategic recommendation.\n\n\n8.8.2 Why It Works for HR\nHR problems rarely have single “correct” answers. They exist at the intersection of psychology, law, business strategy, and ethics. This technique forces students to consider legitimate but competing perspectives and make informed choices about priorities and trade-offs.\n\n\n8.8.3 The Student Prompt (Ready to Use)\nI need to address high turnover in our sales department (35% annual turnover;\nindustry average is 18%). This is affecting team morale, increasing\nrecruitment costs, and impacting customer relationships.\n\nCreate three expert personas who will each analyse this problem from their\nprofessional perspective:\n\n**Expert 1: Organisational Psychologist**\nFocus on: Employee motivation, job satisfaction, workplace culture, team\ndynamics, psychological contracts\n\n**Expert 2: Compensation & Benefits Specialist**\nFocus on: Pay equity, market competitiveness, incentive structures, total\nrewards, cost-benefit analysis\n\n**Expert 3: Talent Management Strategist**\nFocus on: Career development, succession planning, retention programs,\nemployee value proposition, organisational capability\n\nHave each expert independently provide:\n1. Their diagnosis of why turnover is high (from their perspective)\n2. Their recommended intervention strategy\n3. Potential risks or limitations of their recommended approach\n4. What data they would need to validate their hypothesis\n\nAfter all three experts have provided their analysis, I will synthesize\ntheir recommendations and develop my own strategic recommendation.\n\nBegin with Expert 1: Organisational Psychologist.\n\n\n8.8.4 What Happens\nThe AI creates three distinct voices:\nOrganizational Psychologist: &gt; “The 35% turnover suggests a breakdown in psychological contract or poor person-organization fit. Sales roles are inherently stressful, but this level suggests systemic issues,possibly unrealistic targets, poor management relationships, or lack of autonomy. I recommend: (1) Conduct stay/exit interview analysis focusing on psychological factors, (2) Assess manager-employee relationship quality, (3) Review goal-setting processes…”\nCompensation Specialist: &gt; “At 35% turnover, you’re likely seeing pay inequity or uncompetitive base/commission structures. Sales talent is mobile and market-driven. I recommend: (1) Conduct compensation benchmarking against competitors, (2) Analyse pay dispersion within the team, (3) Review commission structures for fairness and achievability…”\nTalent Management Strategist: &gt; “High turnover in sales suggests limited growth opportunities or unclear career paths. Top performers leave when they plateau. I recommend: (1) Map career progression pathways, (2) Implement mentoring for high-potentials, (3) Create lateral development opportunities…”\n\n\n8.8.5 The Follow-Up Task\nAfter receiving all three perspectives, students must:\n\nCompare and Contrast:\n\nWhere do the experts agree?\nWhere do they conflict?\nWhich diagnosis seems most plausible given the evidence?\n\nSynthesize:\n\n“If I could only implement one intervention, which would have the most impact?”\n“How could I combine elements from multiple recommendations?”\n“What’s the minimum viable intervention that addresses multiple root causes?”\n\nJustify with Theory:\n\n“Which HR theory best explains my chosen approach?” (e.g., Herzberg’s two-factor theory, social exchange theory, expectancy theory)\n“What evidence would I need to collect to validate my choice?”\n\nAcknowledge Trade-offs:\n\n“What am I deprioritizing by choosing this approach?”\n“What are the risks if my diagnosis is wrong?”\n\n\n\n\n8.8.6 Variations for Different Topics\nVariation 1: Policy Design\nThree experts debate a proposed \"Bring Your Own Device\" policy:\n- IT Security Officer (focus: data protection, cybersecurity)\n- HR Manager (focus: employee experience, equity, privacy)\n- CFO (focus: cost savings, business case, ROI)\n\nEach argues for their priorities. Student must design a policy that\nbalances all three perspectives.\nVariation 2: Ethical Dilemma\nThree experts analyse whether to implement mandatory return-to-office:\n- Employee Relations Specialist (focus: morale, retention, fairness)\n- Operations Manager (focus: productivity, collaboration, efficiency)\n- Legal Counsel (focus: contractual obligations, discrimination risk, WHS)\n\nStudent must recommend a policy that is ethical, legal, and operationally sound.\nVariation 3: Change Management\nThree experts advise on implementing AI resume screening:\n- Diversity & Inclusion Officer (focus: algorithmic bias, equity)\n- Recruitment Lead (focus: efficiency, candidate experience)\n- Risk & Compliance Manager (focus: legal compliance, audit trails)\n\nStudent must design an implementation plan that addresses all concerns.\n\n\n8.8.7 Teaching Tip: Assessment Application\nAssignment: Multi-Expert Consultation Report\nStudent Requirements: 1. Generate consultation with 3 experts on an assigned HR problem 2. Submit full transcript of expert advice 3. Write 1000-word synthesis report including: - Summary of each expert’s position - Analysis of agreements and conflicts - Your strategic recommendation with justification - Theoretical framework supporting your choice - Implementation risks and mitigation strategies\nWhat You’re Assessing: - Ability to understand multiple valid perspectives - Synthesis and integration skills - Strategic decision-making under ambiguity - Application of HR theory to justify choices - Recognition of trade-offs and constraints\n\n\n8.8.8 Why This Is Powerful\nMost business teaching presents one “correct” approach. But professional practice requires navigating competing legitimate perspectives.\nThis technique teaches: - No single expert has the complete answer - Good business decisions balance multiple priorities and perspectives - Strategic thinking means choosing which perspective to prioritize when - Justification matters more than the specific choice - Real problems require synthesis, not just analysis\n\n\n8.8.9 Combining with Other Techniques\nExpert Panel works brilliantly with:\nPros and Cons (Technique 2): &gt; “After consulting the expert panel, use the Pros and Cons technique to evaluate each expert’s recommended intervention systematically.”\nDebating (Technique 5): &gt; “Have the three experts debate each other’s recommendations. Then you arbitrate and make the final decision.”\nRole Play (Technique 4): &gt; “After developing your strategy based on expert consultation, role-play presenting it to a skeptical stakeholder (CFO, union rep, CEO) and defend your choices.”",

    "text": "8.9 Technique 8 (Extended): Prompt Chaining - Combining Techniques Into Multi-Step Workflows\nAll seven techniques above are powerful on their own. But the real sophistication comes when you chain them together,creating a multi-step workflow where each step builds on the previous one.\nThis is where prompt chaining becomes a meta-technique: a way to orchestrate the other techniques into complex, professional-grade learning experiences.\n\n8.9.1 What Is Prompt Chaining in Teaching?\nPrompt chaining is guiding students through a sequence of prompts where each one builds on the previous result. The student doesn’t just use one technique once,they use multiple techniques in sequence to work through a realistic professional challenge.\nThe educator directs the sequence. You’re like a curriculum designer orchestrating a learning journey: “First, reverse-prompt the problem. Then pros-and-cons the solutions. Then role-play explaining the decision.”\n\n\n8.9.2 Simple Example: From Analysis to Action\nInstead of: “Use Pros and Cons to evaluate supply chain strategies”\nTry: A chain where students: 1. Reverse Prompt to scope all the constraints (cost, delivery, reliability, sustainability) 2. Pros and Cons to evaluate three different strategies against those constraints 3. Chain of Thought to walk through implementation of the chosen strategy step-by-step 4. Role Play to practice presenting the decision to skeptical stakeholders 5. Reflection prompt to debrief what they learned\nSame techniques, but sequenced into a realistic professional process.\n\n\n8.9.3 Teaching Application by Discipline\n\nBusiness & MarketingManagementHuman ResourcesSupply Chain & LogisticsInformation SystemsAccounting & FinanceEconomics\n\n\nMarketing Strategy Workflow:\n\nReverse Prompt: “What information do you need to develop a market entry strategy?”\nPros and Cons: “Evaluate three market entry approaches (partnership, acquisition, organic growth)”\nRole Play: “Present your recommendation to the board and handle their objections”\nReflection: “What would you change if you had to implement this?”\n\n\n\nChange Management Workflow:\n\nReverse Prompt: “What factors must be considered in organisational change?”\nExpert Panel: “Consult three perspectives: HR, Operations, Finance”\nPros and Cons: “Evaluate change approaches based on stakeholder readiness”\nRole Play: “Communicate the change to resistant employees”\nReflection: “What resistance did you encounter? How would you respond?”\n\n\n\nPolicy Development Workflow:\n\nReverse Prompt: “What legal, ethical, and operational requirements must we consider?”\nPros and Cons: “Evaluate policy approaches for fairness and feasibility”\nDebating: “Have different stakeholders debate the policy implications”\nRole Play: “Explain the policy to employees and answer their concerns”\nReflection: “Where is the policy strongest? Weakest? How would you refine it?”\n\n\n\nSupply Chain Resilience Workflow:\n\nReverse Prompt: “What risks could disrupt our supply chain?”\nPros and Cons: “Evaluate resilience strategies (diversification, inventory, redundancy)”\nChain of Thought: “Walk through how each strategy addresses different risk scenarios”\nRole Play: “Present your resilience plan to executives; handle budget objections”\nReflection: “What trade-offs are inherent in each strategy?”\n\n\n\nSystem Implementation Workflow:\n\nReverse Prompt: “What requirements must the system meet? What constraints exist?”\nPros and Cons: “Evaluate implementation approaches (big bang, phased, hybrid)”\nExpert Panel: “Consult IT, Business, Finance perspectives on each approach”\nRole Play: “Explain the implementation timeline to stakeholders concerned about disruption”\nReflection: “What could go wrong? How would you mitigate those risks?”\n\n\n\nAudit Planning Workflow:\n\nReverse Prompt: “What audit objectives and risks must we address?”\nChain of Thought: “Walk through audit procedures for each major account”\nPros and Cons: “Evaluate sample size and testing approaches”\nRole Play: “Present audit findings to management; defend your conclusions”\nReflection: “Where was your judgment critical? How did you justify it?”\n\n\n\nEconomic Policy Workflow:\n\nReverse Prompt: “What economic outcomes are we trying to achieve? What constraints exist?”\nPros and Cons: “Evaluate policy interventions (taxation, regulation, incentives)”\nDebating: “Have economists debate the trade-offs and unintended consequences”\nRole Play: “Present policy recommendation to government; address political objections”\nReflection: “What assumptions did your analysis depend on? How would different assumptions change conclusions?”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.9.4 Why Chaining Is Powerful\nSingle technique: “Use Pros and Cons to evaluate strategies” - Student gets practice with one skill - Output is an analysis\nChained sequence: The same technique embedded in a multi-step workflow - Student practices techniques in realistic sequence - Student sees how one decision flows into the next - Student experiences professional decision-making (not just academic analysis) - Output is a defensible professional recommendation with supporting work\nThe chain transforms isolated skill practice into authentic professional simulation.\n\n\n8.9.5 How to Design a Prompt Chain for Your Teaching\nStep 1: Identify the Real Professional Process What does a practitioner actually do in your discipline?\n\nHR: Scope problem → Consult stakeholders → Evaluate options → Draft policy → Communicate → Refine\nSupply Chain: Identify risks → Evaluate responses → Model impacts → Present strategy → Implement\nFinance: Identify question → Gather data → Analyse alternatives → Justify decision → Present findings\n\nStep 2: Map This to Techniques Which techniques align with each phase?\n\nScoping → Reverse Prompt\nExploring options → Pros and Cons\nUnderstanding implementation → Chain of Thought\nHandling resistance → Role Play\nSynthesis → Reflection\n\nStep 3: Create the Student Sequence Don’t ask students to do all five at once. Guide them step by step:\nSTEP 1 (Reverse Prompt): \"What factors must we consider in choosing a supplier?\"\n[Student lists factors, you provide feedback]\n\nSTEP 2 (Pros and Cons): \"Good list. Now evaluate three suppliers against these factors.\"\n[Student analyses, you refine together]\n\nSTEP 3 (Chain of Thought): \"Now walk me through implementation. What happens in weeks 1-4? 5-8? What risks emerge?\"\n[Student thinks through implementation]\n\nSTEP 4 (Role Play): \"Now pitch this supplier choice to the procurement committee. Address their cost concerns.\"\n[Student practices presenting]\n\nSTEP 5 (Reflection): \"What was difficult? What would you do differently next time?\"\n[Student reflects on learning]\n\n\n8.9.6 Assessment Through Chained Workflows\nInstead of individual assignments, students complete workflow chains as summative assessments.\nExample: HR Policy Development (worth 50% of grade)\nStudents work through this 5-week chain:\n\nWEEK 1: Reverse Prompt to scope the policy problem\nDeliverable: Requirements document (500 words)\n\nWEEK 2: Pros and Cons to evaluate policy approaches\nDeliverable: Comparative analysis of three approaches (1000 words)\n\nWEEK 3: Draft policy using Chain of Thought\nDeliverable: Full policy document with implementation notes (1500 words)\n\nWEEK 4: Role Play explaining policy to stakeholders\nDeliverable: Transcript of three role-play scenarios with reflection (800 words)\n\nWEEK 5: Synthesis and reflection\nDeliverable: 1000-word reflection on your policy design process\n- What worked well?\n- What surprised you?\n- How would you refine the policy?\n- What would you do differently next time?\n- What did you learn about policy development?\n\nTotal: ~5000 words of work that mirrors the actual professional process\nAssessment: Evaluation at each step ensures quality throughout\nThis is not assigning students to “write a policy.” This is walking them through the thinking process professionals actually use, and assessing their work at each stage.\n\n\n8.9.7 When to Use Prompt Chaining\nUse chaining when you want students to: - Experience realistic professional workflows - Build complex skills incrementally (not all at once) - See how early decisions affect later choices - Practice managing uncertainty and iteration - Develop professional judgment (not just knowledge) - Create substantial, sophisticated work products\n\n\n8.9.8 The Magic Happens in the Chain\nSingle prompts are useful. But the real teaching power is in the sequence.\nWhen you chain techniques together: - The student’s learning mirrors actual professional practice - You can see their thinking process at each step - You can intervene and adjust based on their work - The final product is something they actually built, not just received from AI - They develop professional confidence through realistic practice",

Unlike humans, who can maintain focus across days of conversation, AI has specific limitations:\nThe good news? Understanding and managing context is a learnable skill that directly improves output quality, saves time, and reduces errors.\nThis is particularly important for educators because: - You’ll be having longer conversations (designing units, iterating on assignments) - You’ll need high-quality outputs (teaching materials must be accurate) - You’ll want consistent quality across multiple deliverables (course redesigns, prompt libraries) - You’ll be modelling these skills for students",

    "section": "9.2 The Four Core Problems",
    "text": "9.2 The Four Core Problems\n\n9.2.1 Problem 1: The Long Conversation Problem\nWhat happens: You’ve been working with AI for 20 exchanges, refining a unit design. The conversation is great, but when you ask question 21, AI gives you an answer that contradicts something from exchange 5.\nWhy: As conversations grow longer, older information becomes less salient to the AI’s attention. While technically the AI can “see” the entire conversation, information from early exchanges has less influence on later responses.\nTeaching impact: When designing complex units or courses, you’ll have lengthy conversations. Without managing context, outputs become inconsistent.\n\n\n\n9.2.2 Problem 2: Output Token Scarcity\nWhat happens: You ask AI to “redesign this unit, create a rubric, write student instructions, design an assessment, and create a facilitator guide.” You get five things, but each is shallow because AI divided its output tokens five ways.\nWhy: Every model has a maximum output token limit (typically 2,000–4,000 tokens). If you ask for 5 things, you get roughly 400–800 tokens per thing. Quality suffers.\nTeaching impact: You might get a “complete” unit design that needs heavy revision, or you abandon it and start over,wasting time.\n\n\n\n9.2.3 Problem 3: Hallucination Acceleration\nWhat happens: As conversations get longer, AI becomes more likely to “confidently generate false information”,making up citations, inventing examples, or misremembering earlier statements.\nWhy: Longer conversations increase uncertainty. AI is tracking more information and making more inferential leaps. It tries to fill gaps with plausible-sounding but false information.\nTeaching impact: Teaching materials with invented examples or false citations are problematic. Students trust what they see in your materials.\n\n\n\n9.2.4 Problem 4: Lost Context Across Sessions\nWhat happens: You close the chat. Next week, you want to continue designing that unit. You paste your earlier thinking into a new chat, but AI doesn’t have the full conversation history. It repeats earlier points or misses nuance.\nWhy: Each new conversation starts fresh. AI has no memory of previous sessions unless you explicitly provide that history.\nTeaching impact: Multi-week projects (semester redesigns, curriculum overhauls) become fragmented. You must re-establish context repeatedly.",

Create new learning outcomes,\ndesign assessments, write student instructions, create a rubric, and draft\na unit description.\"\nBreak it into steps,first, ask for a plan:\nI'm redesigning a unit on supply chain management for 3rd-year business\nstudents (40 students, mix of majors). Help me create a structured plan.\n\nWhat are the key steps I should follow to redesign this unit? List them in\nlogical order with what we should accomplish at each step.\nAI response: You get a plan like: 1. Clarify learning outcomes (what students should be able to do) 2. Design assessments (how you’ll know they’ve learned) 3. Plan learning activities (what students will do to learn) 4. Create student instructions (what students need to know) 5. Build assessment rubric (how you’ll grade) 6. Write facilitator notes (guidance for teaching)\nThen work through the plan one step at a time:\nStep 1:\nLet's start with step 1: Learning Outcomes.\n\nHere are my current outcomes: [paste]\n\nHelp me evaluate these:\n- Which are clear and measurable?\n- Which are too vague?\n- Which are most important for supply chain professionals?\n\nSuggest 3–4 revised outcomes that focus on authentic supply chain thinking.\nStep 2 (after reviewing Step 1 output):\nGood. Now step 2: Assessment Design.\n\nFor these outcomes: [paste]\n\nSuggest three assessment approaches that would authentically test these outcomes.\nFor each, explain:\n- What students do\n- Why it tests supply chain thinking\n- How it would work with 40 students\nAnd so on. By breaking the work into steps, each output gets full attention and quality improves.\n\n\n9.3.2 Example 2: Semester Course Planning\nInstead of: “Design a 12-week course on organisational behavior.”\nAsk for a plan first:\nI'm teaching organisational behaviour to 2nd-year business students (60 students,\nfirst-year of their major). Help me structure this 12-week course.\n\nWhat are the major topics we should cover? In what order? What's the learning\narc across the semester? What should be the rough focus of each week or pair\nof weeks?\nThen work through week-by-week or module-by-module:\nUsing the plan above, let's design Week 1-2: Introduction to Organisational\nBehavior.\n\nLearning focus: [paste from plan]\n\nDesign these weeks including:\n- 2–3 key concepts to introduce\n- 1 major activity or case study\n- 1 short formative assessment\n- Approximately 3–4 readings\n\nMake it manageable for a 3-hour/week course.",

Each element is skeletal. Outcomes might be vague. Activities are one-liners. Rubric has minimal criteria.\nBetter approach (one task per prompt):\nPrompt 1:\nI'm teaching critical thinking to business undergraduates. I want them to\nbe able to analyse business problems from multiple perspectives.\n\nDesign 3 classroom activities that help students practice critical thinking.\nFor each activity:\n- Describe what students do (step-by-step)\n- Explain what they'll learn\n- Note how long it takes\n- Indicate the group size (individual, small group, whole class)\nPrompt 2 (after reviewing):\nGood activities. Now let's build an assessment rubric for evaluating students'\ncritical thinking. Include:\n- 4–5 criteria (e.g., perspective-taking, evidence use, reasoning clarity)\n- For each criterion, descriptors for: Excellent / Proficient / Developing\n\nKeep it usable for grading real student work.\nPrompt 3 (after reviewing):\nTurn the activities and rubric into a one-page student handout. Include:\n- What they're learning (1–2 sentences)\n- Why it matters professionally (1–2 sentences)\n- The activities (clear instructions)\n- Success criteria (what \"good\" looks like)\n- How to get help if stuck\n\nMake it accessible and encouraging.\nResult: Deep. Each element is thoughtful, specific, and builds on what came before.\n\n\n9.4.2 Exception: When Multiple Things Are Fine\nSometimes asking for multiple outputs makes sense: - Comparative tasks: “Show me 3 different ways to teach [concept]. What are the trade-offs of each?” - Structured formats: “Create an outline with: learning outcomes, key concepts, and 3 discussion questions” - Quick iterations: “Now make that more concise / more challenging / more inclusive” - Batched similar tasks: “Write 5 discussion questions on these topics: [list]. Each should take 10 minutes of discussion.”\nThe key: Are the outputs relatively equal in scope and complexity? If yes, ask for multiple. If one task is much bigger than others, split them.",

Can you summarize what we've accomplished?\n\nInclude:\n- What problem or task we started with\n- Key decisions we made\n- What we've created/designed so far\n- What still needs to be done\n\nMake it concise but complete—something I can copy and paste into a new\nconversation to continue working.\nAI provides a summary.

Learning outcomes (5 outcomes emphasizing strategic thinking)\n2. Assessment strategy (3 assessments: case analysis, risk simulation, team project)\n3. Week-by-week learning plan (12 weeks structured around decisions)\n\n**What's left:**\n- Detailed activity instructions for each week\n- Facilitator notes on how to run discussions\n- Student rubric for team project\n\n**Next step:** Design the Week 1-2 activities in detail.\nYou then start a new conversation and continue with: “I’m continuing supply chain unit redesign.

When the simulation should end\n\n10.4.1 Setup Prompt (Ready to Use)\nYou are Alex Chen, a 32-year-old software engineer who has worked at\nTechCorp for three years. You were a high performer until six months ago,\nwhen your work quality declined noticeably.\n\nBACKGROUND CONTEXT:\n- You have missed three project deadlines in the past four months\n- Your code quality has dropped—recent pull requests have had multiple bugs\n  that QA caught\n- You've been arriving late to work 2-3 times per week\n- Your manager has already had one informal conversation with you about\n  these concerns two months ago, but things have not improved\n- You are being placed on a formal 60-day Performance Improvement Plan (PIP)\n\nYOUR PERSONA AND BEHAVIOR:\n- You are defensive and embarrassed. You feel this PIP is unfair and harsh.\n- You believe your recent work is \"good enough\" and that your manager has\n  unrealistic expectations\n- You are dealing with a stressful personal situation (caring for an aging\n  parent), but you have not told your manager about this—you believe it's\n  private and not relevant to work\n- You are not aggressive or hostile, but you are resistant and will push\n  back on criticism\n- If the HR person or manager shows genuine empathy and asks open questions,\n  you will gradually reveal some personal context\n- If they are accusatory or dismissive, you will shut down and become\n  minimal in your responses\n\nTHE MEETING:\nI am the HR representative (or the manager) conducting the PIP meeting with\nyou. This is a formal meeting. You have just been told this is a PIP\ndiscussion.\n\nYOUR GOAL:\n- React as Alex would realistically react\n- Challenge the fairness of the process if it seems rushed or poorly\n  explained\n- Reveal personal information only if trust is established\n- Show emotion (frustration, stress, worry) but remain professional\n- Respond dynamically to how I conduct the meeting\n\nStay in character throughout. Begin the meeting by responding to my opening\nstatement. I will start the conversation now.\nKey Design Elements: - Complexity: Alex isn’t purely defensive or purely cooperative,there’s legitimate work performance decline and extenuating circumstances - Realistic emotion: Alex is stressed and embarrassed, not theatrical or extreme - Conditional behaviour: How Alex responds depends on the student’s approach (rewards good technique) - Hidden information: The personal context isn’t revealed unless the student asks the right questions with the right tone",

Here’s an example of how this might play out.\n\n10.5.1 Example Conversation\nStudent (HR Rep): &gt; “Hi Alex, thanks for meeting with me. I want to talk with you today about some performance concerns that have been raised. I know this is a difficult conversation, but I want to make sure we have an open discussion about what’s been happening and how we can support you moving forward.”\nAI (as Alex): &gt; shifts uncomfortably “Yeah, I’ve been hearing whispers about this. Look, I know I’ve missed a couple of deadlines, but I don’t think things are as bad as people are making out. I’m still getting my work done. Is this really necessary?”\nStudent: &gt; “I understand this feels uncomfortable. Let me be specific about the concerns. Over the past four months, you’ve missed three major project deadlines,the payment gateway integration in March, the API update in April, and the mobile optimization in May. Additionally, QA has flagged an increase in bugs in your recent code submissions. These are measurable changes from your previous performance standard. Can you help me understand what’s been happening?”\nAI (as Alex): &gt; pauses, looks down “I mean… yeah, okay, I’ve had some issues. But deadlines get missed sometimes, right? And bugs happen. I just feel like everyone’s being really harsh all of a sudden. I had one conversation with my manager about this two months ago, and now suddenly I’m on a PIP? That feels pretty extreme.”\nStudent: &gt; “That’s a fair question, Alex. You did have an informal conversation with your manager in early April where these concerns were raised. At that time, you both agreed on some strategies to get things back on track. Since then, we’ve continued to see the same patterns,another deadline missed last month and continued quality issues. A PIP isn’t a punishment; it’s a structured way to clearly define expectations, provide support, and give you a fair opportunity to improve. Does that make sense?”\nAI (as Alex): &gt; sighs “I guess. I just… it’s been a really tough few months personally, okay? I know that’s not your problem, but it’s not like I’m just slacking off or don’t care anymore.”\nStudent: &gt; “Thank you for sharing that, Alex. I appreciate that personal circumstances can affect work, and I’m genuinely sorry you’re dealing with difficult things. If there are specific supports we can offer,whether that’s adjustments to your schedule, access to our Employee Assistance Program, or other accommodations,we’re open to discussing that. But we also need to be clear about the performance standards that need to be met. Can we talk about what support might help you succeed during this PIP period?”\nAI (as Alex): &gt; softens slightly “Honestly, I’ve been dealing with my dad’s health declining. I’ve been having to take him to medical appointments, and I’m the only family member nearby. Some mornings I’m exhausted because I’ve been up half the night. I didn’t want to bring it into work because… I don’t know, I thought I could just handle it.”\nStudent: &gt; “I’m really sorry to hear about your father, Alex. That’s incredibly stressful. I’m glad you’ve told me, because this is exactly the kind of situation where we want to support our employees. Have you considered whether a temporary flexible schedule might help,perhaps starting later on days when you have early appointments, or adjusting your hours? We can also connect you with our EAP, which offers counseling and support for family caregivers. Would either of those be helpful?”\nAI (as Alex): &gt; nods “Yeah… actually, that might really help. I didn’t know that was an option. I’ve just been trying to power through, but clearly that’s not working.”\nStudent: &gt; “I appreciate your honesty. So here’s what I suggest: we’ll document this PIP with clear performance targets,specific deadlines and quality standards. But we’ll also document the support measures we’re putting in place, including flexible scheduling where possible. This gives you the structure and the support to get back to the high performance standard we know you’re capable of. The PIP period is 60 days. At the 30-day mark, we’ll have a check-in to see how things are going. Does that sound fair?”\nAI (as Alex): &gt; takes a breath “Okay. Yeah. I mean, it’s still stressful to be on a PIP, but I get it. And if I can actually get some flexibility with the schedule, that would help a lot. I don’t want to lose this job,I just need to get things back on track.”\nStudent: &gt; “That’s exactly the goal, Alex. We want you to succeed. Let’s schedule a follow-up meeting next week to formalize the flexible schedule arrangement and go through the detailed PIP document. Thank you for being open with me today,that’s really important.”\nAI (as Alex): &gt; manages a small, tired smile “Thanks. I appreciate you actually listening.”",

This is critical for procedural fairness.\nYou also clearly explained the purpose of the PIP: “A PIP isn’t a punishment; it’s a structured way to clearly define expectations, provide support, and give you a fair opportunity to improve.” This reframing helped reduce Alex’s defensiveness.\nWhere you could improve: You could have been even more explicit about the timeline and previous feedback. While you mentioned the April conversation, you could have said: “We had a conversation on April 3rd where we documented three specific concerns. We agreed you would [specific actions]. Since then, we’ve seen [specific outcomes]. That’s why we’re now moving to a formal PIP.”\nSuggestion: Always reference specific dates and documented prior warnings. This strengthens the legal defensibility of your process.\n\n2. COMMUNICATION EFFECTIVENESS: 10/10\nWhat you did well: Your use of empathy was outstanding. When Alex revealed personal stress, you immediately acknowledged it: “Thank you for sharing that, Alex. I appreciate that personal circumstances can affect work, and I’m genuinely sorry you’re dealing with difficult things.” This response validated Alex’s feelings while maintaining professional boundaries.\nYou also used excellent open-ended questions: “Can you help me understand what’s been happening?” This invited dialogue rather than putting Alex on the defensive.\nYour handling of defensiveness was textbook-perfect. When Alex said the PIP felt “extreme,” you didn’t argue or dismiss,you acknowledged the concern (“That’s a fair question”) and then explained the rationale.\nWhere you could improve: Nothing significant. Your communication was professional, empathetic, and effective throughout.\n\n3. LEGAL AND ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS: 9/10\nWhat you did well: When Alex disclosed caregiving responsibilities, you immediately offered accommodations: “Have you considered whether a temporary flexible schedule might help?” This is legally and ethically sound,you’re demonstrating that the company is willing to make reasonable adjustments, which protects against claims of unfair dismissal or discrimination.\nYou also avoided making assumptions or probing inappropriately into Alex’s personal life. You accepted the disclosure, offered support, and moved the conversation forward professionally.\nWhere you could improve: You should explicitly document this conversation. At the end of the meeting, you could have said: “I’m going to document today’s conversation, including your disclosure about your father’s health and the flexible schedule accommodation we’ve discussed. You’ll receive a copy of this documentation for your records.”\nSuggestion: Always verbally confirm that documentation will be provided. This ensures transparency and gives the employee a chance to correct any misunderstandings immediately.\n\n4. APPLICATION OF HR THEORY: 8/10\nWhat you did well: You demonstrated understanding of motivational theory by balancing challenge with support. You didn’t just impose standards,you co-created solutions by asking, “Can we talk about what support might help you succeed during this PIP period?”\nYou also applied principles of procedural justice by ensuring Alex felt heard and treated fairly, which research shows increases acceptance of difficult decisions.\nWhere you could improve: You could have applied goal-setting theory more explicitly. When finalising the PIP, you mentioned “clear performance targets,” but you didn’t collaboratively define them in the meeting. Research shows that when employees participate in setting their own goals, commitment and achievement increase.\nSuggestion: In your follow-up meeting, involve Alex in defining the specific, measurable targets for the PIP. For example: “What do you think is a realistic number of on-time deliverables over the next 30 days, given the support we’re putting in place?” This increases ownership and reduces resistance.\n\nOVERALL ASSESSMENT\nLikely Outcome: Based on how you conducted this meeting, Alex is likely to:\n\nFeel that the process was fair, even though it’s stressful\nEngage constructively with the PIP rather than resist or disengage\nUtilise the flexible schedule accommodation\nHave a reasonable chance of meeting the performance standards during the 60-day period\n\nWhy: You established psychological safety (Alex felt safe disclosing personal information), you demonstrated empathy without compromising standards, and you offered concrete support. This is exactly the balance effective HR professionals must strike.\nOne Risk to Watch: Ensure that the flexible schedule accommodation is documented and approved by the manager. If the manager later claims they weren’t consulted or don’t agree, this could create conflict. Always confirm that proposed accommodations are feasible with all stakeholders before committing to them in a meeting.\n\nFINAL SCORE: 36/40 (90%)\nThis was a highly competent performance. You demonstrated strong communication skills, applied HR principles effectively, and handled a complex, emotionally charged situation with professionalism and empathy. The areas for improvement are minor and relate to documentation and collaborative goal-setting,both easily addressed in your follow-up meeting.",

    "text": "10.12 Common Questions\nQ: Won’t students just keep trying until the AI gives them a good score?\nA: That’s actually a feature, not a bug. In professional development, repetition until competence is exactly what we want. However, you can require students to submit all attempts, not just their best one. This shows their learning journey and prevents gaming the system.\nQ: What if students share their transcripts and just copy each other’s approach?\nA: Design the scenarios with variability. Give each student a slightly different context (different employee persona, different performance issue, different complicating factor). The skills they’re practicing remain the same, but the conversations will be unique.\nQ: How do I know the AI’s critique is accurate?\nA: You should review a sample of critiques initially to ensure quality. However, because you write the critique prompt with specific criteria tied to your learning objectives, the AI’s assessment will align with your rubric. You’re essentially scaling your own assessment criteria.\nQ: Can students do this with voice instead of text?\nA: Yes! Many AI tools now support voice conversation mode. Students can literally speak their way through the simulation, making it even more realistic. The conversation can then be transcribed for the critique phase.",

    "text": "12.3 The Three-Part Framework for Ethical AI Use\nThis framework works for talking to students, colleagues, and administrators. It has three components:\n\n12.3.1 1. Transparency (Not Prohibition)\nThe principle: Make AI use explicit, expected, and assessable rather than hidden and policed.\nIn practice: - Tell students exactly when and how they can use AI - Provide the prompts and tools yourself - Assess their use of AI, not their avoidance of AI - Reward students who identify AI’s errors and limitations\nWhy this builds integrity: When AI use is transparent, students learn to use it openly and responsibly. When it’s prohibited, students use it secretly and don’t develop critical oversight skills.\n\n\n12.3.2 2. Critical Oversight (Not Blind Reliance)\nThe principle: Teach students that AI is a tool requiring human judgment, not an authority to be trusted.\nIn practice: - Design assignments where students must critique or override AI outputs - Require students to identify what AI gets wrong - Grade students on their ability to improve on AI suggestions - Show examples of AI failures (bias, errors, oversimplification)\nWhy this builds integrity: Students learn that using AI thoughtfully is harder than avoiding it. They develop the professional habit of verification and critical thinking.\n\n\n12.3.3 3. Professional Relevance (Not Academic Abstraction)\nThe principle: Connect AI use in coursework to AI use in professional practice.\nIn practice: - Frame assignments as professional scenarios: “You’re the HR manager using AI to draft a policy…” - Discuss workplace AI ethics: “What happens if your AI resume screening tool discriminates?” - Teach governance: “Who is accountable when AI-assisted decisions go wrong?” - Include AI literacy as a stated learning objective in your unit outline\nWhy this builds integrity: When students see AI use as professional skill development rather than academic shortcut, they engage differently. They’re not “cheating the system”,they’re practicing for their careers.",

    "section": "12.4 Data Governance: The Practical Reality",
    "text": "12.4 Data Governance: The Practical Reality\nWhile your institution may have an approved enterprise LLM with data protections, the reality is that students will use multiple tools. Some will have strong data governance; others won’t. This section addresses the data governance considerations you need to discuss with students and build into your assignment design.\n\n12.4.1 The Data Governance Landscape\nDifferent LLMs handle data differently:\nEnterprise/Approved Tools (e.g., MS Copilot Enterprise with Curtin license) - Data is siloed and protected within the enterprise - Individual user data is isolated - Training data exclusions in place - Compliance with institutional requirements - Appropriate for: Course materials, assignments, institutional data\nConsumer/Free Tools (e.g., ChatGPT free tier, Bing Chat, standard Claude) - User conversations may be retained for model improvement - Data could potentially be used for training future models - Less transparency about data handling - No institutional protection or agreement - Risk: Course materials, assignment content, student work uploaded here can be incorporated into training data\nThe Student Reality While you may recommend (or require) students use MS Copilot Enterprise, students will inevitably use other tools:\n\nMore familiar interfaces\nNo Curtin login required\nAccess on personal devices/accounts\nPeer recommendations\n“Just quickly checking” with ChatGPT\n\nThis isn’t a failure of your instruction,it’s the reality of tool adoption. Your role is to help students make informed choices, not to prevent use of other tools entirely. For strategic thinking about larger-scale risks, see the Strategic Risk Thinking section later in this chapter.\n\n\n12.4.2 Institutional Context: Curtin University\nAt Curtin University, staff have the Enterprise license for MS Copilot specifically because: - Data Protection: Your data and your students’ work is siloed within Curtin’s instance - Institutional Compliance: Meets Curtin’s data governance and privacy requirements - Professional Standard: Reflects how enterprise professionals use AI tools - Approved Use: This is the officially sanctioned tool for institutional work\nWhat This Means in Practice: - Course materials and institutional data should be processed through MS Copilot Enterprise - Student assignments containing course content are safer in MS Copilot Enterprise - Sensitive institutional information should never go into consumer LLMs - Teaching students to use the enterprise tool is teaching them to work like professionals\n\n\n12.4.3 Data Governance Considerations for Assignment Design\nRather than prohibiting certain tools (impossible to enforce), design assignments that naturally encourage responsible data handling:\n\n12.4.3.1 Strategy 1: Use Generic/Fictional Scenarios\nInstead of: “Upload this real case study and ask the AI to analyse it”\nTry: “Here’s a fictional scenario. Analyse it using the provided AI tool. What would you need to verify before applying this to real data?”\nBenefit: Students practice with realistic scenarios without uploading sensitive materials.\n\n\n12.4.3.2 Strategy 2: De-Identification Before Upload\nIf students need to work with real or realistic data: - Require them to remove identifying information first - Create assignment steps: “1) Anonymize data, 2) Upload to AI, 3) Document what you removed” - Assess their decision-making about what constitutes sensitive information\nBenefit: Students learn data governance practices they’ll use professionally.\n\n\n12.4.3.3 Strategy 3: Process Documentation Over Output Sharing\nInstead of: “Submit your full AI conversation transcript”\nTry: “Show the three key prompts you used and explain why you modified your approach between each”\nBenefit: Students demonstrate thinking without uploading entire conversations with potentially sensitive content.\n\n\n12.4.3.4 Strategy 4: Explicit Tool Choices in Assignment Design\nBe clear about which tool to use: - “Use MS Copilot Enterprise for this assignment (login with your Curtin credentials)” - “You may use any AI tool for brainstorming, but final analysis should use MS Copilot Enterprise” - “If using a non-approved tool, anonymize all case data first”\nBenefit: Students make informed choices and understand why tool selection matters.\n\n\n12.4.3.5 Strategy 5: Structured Prompts in Approved Tools\nRather than leaving students to compose prompts in any tool they choose, provide: - Prepared prompts already in MS Copilot Enterprise - Shared workspace conversations students can access - Pre-configured scenarios they interact with, rather than create\nBenefit: You control what data enters the system while students still develop prompting skills.\n\n\n\n12.4.4 Student-Facing Guidance on Data Governance\nHere’s language you can adapt for student-facing materials:\nDATA GOVERNANCE AND AI TOOL SELECTION\n\nWe have approved MS Copilot Enterprise for coursework because it protects your data\nand the university's data. Here's what this means:\n\nWHAT HAPPENS WITH YOUR DATA:\n- MS Copilot Enterprise: Your conversations are siloed within Curtin's secure instance.\n  Your data is not used to train other models. Your work is protected.\n\n- Other AI tools (ChatGPT, etc.): Your conversations may be retained and potentially\n  used to improve those services. Anything you upload could theoretically be seen\n  by the company or used in their training.\n\nWHAT THIS MEANS FOR THIS COURSE:\n\nDO use MS Copilot Enterprise when:\n- Working with course materials or case studies\n- Analysing real (or realistic) business scenarios\n- Uploading assignment drafts for feedback\n- Working with any data you wouldn't want public\n\nDO use other tools when:\n- Brainstorming general ideas\n- Exploring concepts with simple, generic examples\n- Personal learning outside formal assignments\n\nDON'T upload to any AI tool:\n- Course materials before they're public\n- Student work (yours or classmates') without permission\n- Real company data or confidential information\n- Anything marked as confidential or proprietary\n\nIF YOU USE OTHER TOOLS:\n- Remove identifying information first (anonymize real data)\n- Document what you removed and why\n- Be prepared to explain your tool choice in class discussion\n- Understand that your data may not be protected the same way\n\nPROFESSIONAL PRACTICE:\nIn your careers, you'll work with different tools in different contexts. This course\nteaches you to think about data governance: Where does data go? Who can see it?\nWhat risks exist? These are questions you'll ask professionally, not just in class.\n\n\n12.4.5 Red Flags: Data Governance Issues\nWatch for assignments or discussions where students might be uploading sensitive information inappropriately:\nRed Flag: Student uploads course materials verbatim into consumer tool - Response: Not acceptable for this assignment. Use MS Copilot Enterprise, or anonymize first.\nRed Flag: Student shares screenshot of conversation with real client names/data - Response: Opportunity to discuss professional confidentiality and data governance in context.\nRed Flag: Assignment design that assumes students will upload confidential materials - Response: Redesign to use fictional scenarios or require de-identification first.\nRed Flag: No mention of data governance in unit outline or assignment instructions - Response: Add explicit guidance about which tools to use and why.\n\n\n12.4.6 Institutional Policy Reference\nAs a Curtin educator, you can reference: - Curtin’s Data Governance Policy - The terms of the MS Copilot Enterprise license - Professional standards in your discipline about data handling - Privacy and confidentiality principles relevant to your field\nThis grounds data governance in institutional reality, not abstract rules.",

Here’s a model you can adapt:\n\n12.5.1 Example: Unit Outline AI Policy Statement\nARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE USE IN THIS UNIT\n\nIn professional practice across all business disciplines, you will use AI tools\nto support decision-making, analysis, and communication. This unit teaches you to\nuse AI responsibly and critically.\n\nWHEN AI USE IS EXPECTED:\n- Assignment 2 (Conversation Simulation / Scenario Analysis): You will interact\n  with AI-generated scenarios or personas and demonstrate your professional skills\n- Assignment 3 (Self-Assessment): You will use the provided AI critique prompt\n  to assess your draft before submission\n- [Any other assignments where AI engagement is part of learning objectives]\n\nWHEN AI USE IS PERMITTED:\n- Brainstorming ideas and approaches\n- Generating practice questions and scenarios for exam preparation\n- Checking grammar and clarity in written work\n- Exploring concepts you don't fully understand yet\n- Researching and understanding professional standards and frameworks\n\nWHEN AI USE IS NOT PERMITTED:\n- Final exam (closed book, no technology unless specified)\n- Any assignment where instructions explicitly state \"no AI tools\"\n- Any assessment explicitly designed to test recall or your unaided thinking\n\nWHAT YOU MUST DO WHEN USING AI:\n- Use it as a tool that supports YOUR thinking, not replaces it\n- Critically evaluate AI outputs—don't assume they're correct\n- Be able to explain and justify any AI-assisted work in your own words\n- Acknowledge AI use where required (e.g., \"I used Claude to generate initial\n  analysis, which I then critically reviewed and revised based on...\")\n\nACADEMIC INTEGRITY EXPECTATIONS:\nUsing AI inappropriately (e.g., submitting AI-generated work as your own without\ncritical engagement) is academic misconduct, just like plagiarism.\n\nIf you're ever unsure whether your AI use is appropriate, ask before submitting.\nI'm here to help you learn to use these tools well and ethically.\n\n\n12.5.2 Example: First-Day Class Discussion\nWhat to say:\n\n“Let’s talk about AI. Some of you are probably already using ChatGPT or similar tools. Some of you are worried that using AI is cheating. Some of you are wondering if I’m going to try to detect and punish AI use.\nHere’s my position: AI tools exist, and you’ll use them in your professional careers. My job is to teach you to use them wisely and ethically.\nIn this unit, we’ll use AI openly in some assignments. You’ll learn when AI is helpful, when it’s risky, and when human judgment must override AI recommendations. That’s a professional skill you’ll need.\nI’m not interested in playing ‘gotcha’ with AI detection software. I’m interested in whether you can think critically, justify your decisions, and demonstrate competent professional practice. If you can do that with AI assistance, great. If you use AI to avoid thinking, I’ll know,because your work won’t demonstrate understanding.\nQuestions or concerns about this approach?”\n\nWhy this works: - Sets a clear, positive tone - Positions you as a guide, not a cop - Acknowledges student anxiety - Makes professional relevance explicit - Invites dialogue",

    "text": "12.6 Designing “Integrity-Resistant” Assignments\nSome assignments are easier to misuse with AI than others. Here’s how to design assessments that are inherently resistant to misuse:\n\n12.6.1 Principle 1: Assess Process, Not Just Product\nVulnerable design: “Write a 1500-word essay analysing a workplace conflict.” - Student can paste this into AI and submit the output\nIntegrity-resistant design: “Conduct a simulated investigation interview (submit transcript), then audit your own process against procedural fairness criteria.” - Student must engage in real-time conversation (can’t be pre-written) - Assessment focuses on methodology visible in transcript - Self-audit requires metacognitive engagement\n\n\n12.6.2 Principle 2: Require Evidence of Thinking\nVulnerable design: “Recommend a solution to this [discipline] problem.” - AI can generate a plausible recommendation\nIntegrity-resistant design: “AI generated three solutions to this problem [provide them]. Critique each option, identify which one is best and why, and explain what the AI got wrong.” - Student must think beyond what AI provided - Requires critical evaluation, not just generation - Makes AI outputs the starting point, not the end point\nExamples by discipline: - HR: “Critique three AI-generated performance management approaches” - Finance: “Critique three AI-generated investment recommendations” - Supply Chain: “Critique three AI-generated supplier selection strategies” - Marketing: “Critique three AI-generated campaign strategies”\n\n\n12.6.3 Principle 3: Make Personal Context Essential\nVulnerable design: “Analyse the pros and cons of [generic professional concept].” - Generic question AI can answer generally\nIntegrity-resistant design: “Based on your earlier [simulation/analysis/project], analyse how [concept] would address the specific situation while meeting [organisational/business requirement].” - Requires integration of previous personalised work - Context is unique to each student - Generic AI response won’t fit\nExamples by discipline: - HR: “Based on your PIP simulation with Jamie, analyse flexible work approaches” - Finance: “Based on your company analysis, evaluate investment timing strategies” - Supply Chain: “Based on your supplier evaluation, analyse relationship strategies” - Marketing: “Based on your segment analysis, evaluate messaging approaches”\n\n\n12.6.4 Principle 4: Assess Revision and Iteration\nVulnerable design: Submit final work only - No visibility into how it was created\nIntegrity-resistant design: Submit first draft, AI feedback received, revised draft, and reflection on changes made - Process is visible and assessable - Shows learning trajectory - Difficult to fake iterative improvement\n\n\n12.6.5 Principle 5: Require Justification of Choices\nVulnerable design: “Create a recruitment interview guide.” - AI can generate a complete guide\nIntegrity-resistant design: “Create an interview guide. For each question, justify why you chose it, what competency it targets, and what poor response would sound like. Identify two questions the AI generated that you rejected and explain why they were inadequate.” - Requires deep understanding, not just production - Student must demonstrate judgment beyond AI capability - Reveals whether they understand what they’re submitting",

    "text": "12.7 Red Flags for AI Misuse (And How to Address Them)\nEven with well-designed assignments, some students will try to misuse AI. Here’s how to identify and respond:\n\n12.7.1 Red Flag 1: Sudden Quality Shift\nWhat you see: Student whose previous work was weak suddenly submits sophisticated analysis.\nResponse approach: - Don’t immediately accuse. There could be legitimate reasons (they got help from writing centre, they finally understood the concept, etc.) - Ask questions: “Your analysis has improved significantly. Can you walk me through your thinking process on this particular section?” - Request elaboration: “This point about organisational justice theory is interesting. Can you explain how you see it applying to this specific scenario?”\nIf genuine learning: They can explain their thinking. If inappropriate AI use: They struggle to explain or elaborate.\n\n\n12.7.2 Red Flag 2: Work That Doesn’t Match Assignment Context\nWhat you see: Student used generic AI response that doesn’t fit the specific scenario or constraints you provided.\nExample: Assignment asked for Australian employment law context, student submitted response referencing US legislation.\nResponse approach: - Point out the mismatch: “I notice you’ve referenced Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, but this assignment requires Australian context. Can you explain how this applies to our scenario?” - Provide opportunity to revise: “I think you may have used a resource that wasn’t contextually appropriate. Please resubmit with correct jurisdictional references.”\nTeaching moment: Use this to discuss the importance of contextual verification when using AI tools professionally.\n\n\n12.7.3 Red Flag 3: No Evidence of Process in Process-Based Assessment\nWhat you see: Student submitted required components but shows no genuine engagement (e.g., self-audit identifies no mistakes, reflection is superficial).\nResponse approach: - Return for revision: “Your self-audit suggests your performance was perfect. Reflective practice requires identifying areas for growth. Please resubmit with honest self-assessment.” - Offer guidance: “Everyone makes mistakes in complex HR conversations. Look specifically at moments where the employee seemed frustrated or defensive,what might you have done differently?”\nTeaching moment: Explain that honest self-assessment is more valuable than false perfection.\n\n\n12.7.4 Red Flag 4: Can’t Explain or Defend Work in Person\nWhat you see: High-quality written submission, but student can’t discuss it in office hours or oral follow-up.\nResponse approach: - For high-stakes situations: Schedule a brief oral examination: “I’d like to discuss your assignment. Can you walk me through your main recommendation and why you chose it?” - Frame it as learning: “I was impressed by your analysis. I’d love to hear more about your thinking process.”\nIf inappropriate use is confirmed: - Follow university academic misconduct procedures - Use it as a teaching moment about professional accountability",

Teach students to identify ethical problems with AI use through discipline-specific scenarios.\n\nHR Exercise: The Flawed AI Termination MemoFinance Exercise: The Flawed AI Investment RecommendationSupply Chain Exercise: The Flawed AI Supplier StrategyMarketing Exercise: The Flawed AI Campaign StrategyInformation Systems Exercise: The Flawed AI System Design\n\n\nAssignment:\n\n“Use AI to draft a termination letter for an employee being dismissed for poor performance after a 60-day PIP.\nThen conduct an ethical audit: - What did the AI include that could create legal risk? - What did the AI omit that’s legally required? - What tone or language choices are problematic? - How would you revise this to ensure procedural fairness?\nYour grade is based on how thoroughly you identify problems, not on the quality of AI’s original output.”\n\nWhat students learn: - AI can confidently generate legally dangerous content - They must verify and correct AI outputs - Professional accountability can’t be delegated to AI\n\n\nAssignment:\n\n“Use AI to recommend an investment portfolio allocation. Then conduct a critical audit: - What assumptions did the AI make about risk tolerance and time horizon? - What did the AI miss about current market conditions? - What tax or regulatory implications are overlooked? - How would you revise this recommendation with your professional judgment?\nYour grade is based on how thoroughly you identify problems and limitations, not on the quality of AI’s original output.”\n\nWhat students learn: - AI can confidently recommend financially risky strategies - Assumptions must be verified and challenged - Professional accountability for recommendations can’t be delegated\n\n\nAssignment:\n\n“Use AI to recommend a supplier consolidation strategy. Then conduct a critical audit: - What supply chain risks did the AI overlook? - What supplier relationship and quality considerations are missing? - What operational constraints wasn’t the AI aware of? - How would you revise this strategy with on-the-ground knowledge?\nYour grade is based on how thoroughly you identify problems and improvements.”\n\nWhat students learn: - AI can oversimplify complex supply chain decisions - Operational reality must inform strategy - Professional judgment about supplier relationships is essential\n\n\nAssignment:\n\n“Use AI to generate a campaign strategy for a target market. Then conduct a critical audit: - What customer insights did the AI miss or misinterpret? - What competitive or market factors aren’t addressed? - What cultural or regional sensitivities might cause problems? - How would you revise this with real market knowledge?\nYour grade is based on how thoroughly you identify problems and improvements.”\n\nWhat students learn: - AI can generate culturally insensitive or market-misaligned strategies - Customer understanding must verify AI outputs - Professional judgment about market nuance is irreplaceable\n\n\nAssignment:\n\n“Use AI to generate system requirements and architecture for a business problem. Then conduct a critical audit: - What technical feasibility concerns exist? - What security or compliance risks are overlooked? - What integration challenges with existing systems aren’t considered? - How would you revise this design with technical expertise?\nYour grade is based on how thoroughly you identify problems and improvements.”\n\nWhat students learn: - AI can generate technically unrealistic designs - Feasibility and constraints must be verified - Professional technical judgment is essential\n\n\n\nCommon Learning Outcome Across All Disciplines: - AI can confidently generate problematic recommendations - Critical verification and improvement is necessary - Professional accountability can’t be delegated to AI\n\n12.8.1 Exercise 2: The AI Bias and Fairness Challenge\nDiscipline-specific scenarios:\n\nHR: The Biased Resume Screening ToolFinance: The Biased Credit Risk ModelSupply Chain: The Biased Supplier Rating SystemMarketing: The Biased Customer Segmentation\n\n\n\n“Your company uses an AI resume screening tool. You notice it consistently ranks candidates from certain universities higher and flags career gaps as negative. Three rejected candidates have complained the process seems unfair.\nAs the HR manager: 1. What are the ethical concerns with this AI tool? 2. What’s your legal risk? 3. Who is accountable for the AI’s decisions? 4. What would you do to address this situation?”\n\n\n\n\n“Your company uses an AI credit risk model for loan decisions. You discover it systematically rates applicants from certain zip codes as higher risk, even when other factors are equivalent. Multiple applicants have filed complaints.\nAs the finance manager: 1. What are the ethical and legal concerns? 2. What’s the regulatory risk? 3. Who is accountable for discriminatory decisions? 4. What would you do to address this?”\n\n\n\n\n“Your AI supplier rating system consistently rates suppliers from certain regions lower, even when quality metrics are equivalent. Key suppliers have complained and are considering leaving.\nAs the supply chain manager: 1. What are the fairness and business risks? 2. What relationship and reputational damage might occur? 3. Who is accountable for biased evaluations? 4. How would you address this?”\n\n\n\n\n“Your AI customer segmentation tool shows significant demographic bias in targeting. Certain groups are consistently excluded from high-value segment classifications. Customer advocacy groups have raised concerns.\nAs the marketing manager: 1. What are the ethical and business risks? 2. What’s the reputational impact? 3. Who is accountable for discriminatory targeting? 4. How would you address this?”\n\n\n\n\nWhat students learn (across all disciplines): - Algorithmic bias is a real professional issue - Using AI doesn’t eliminate human responsibility - Professionals must advocate for fair processes even when using technology\n\n\n12.8.2 Exercise 3: The Over-Reliance Problem\nDiscipline-specific scenarios:\n\nHR: The Over-Reliance on Turnover AnalysisFinance: The Over-Reliance on Market ForecastingSupply Chain: The Over-Reliance on Demand Forecasting\n\n\n\n“You used AI to analyse exit interview data and generate turnover reduction recommendations. You presented them to senior management and implemented them. Six months later, turnover has increased.\nReflection questions: 1. What might the AI have missed in its analysis? 2. What was your professional responsibility before presenting AI recommendations? 3. How do you explain this outcome to management? 4. What does this teach you about using AI in strategic decisions?”\n\n\n\n\n“You used AI to forecast market conditions and recommend investment positions. You presented them to the board and implemented them. Three months later, markets moved contrary to the forecast and positions are significantly underwater.\nReflection questions: 1. What factors might the AI have missed? 2. What was your professional responsibility in validating the forecast? 3. How do you explain this to the board? 4. What does this teach you about AI-assisted decisions?”\n\n\n\n\n“You used AI to forecast demand and optimize inventory. You implemented major supplier and inventory changes based on this. Demand changed unexpectedly and you now have significant stockouts.\nReflection questions: 1. What assumptions might the AI have made incorrectly? 2. What was your responsibility to validate the forecast? 3. How do you explain this to operations and customers? 4. What does this teach you about AI forecasting?”\n\n\n\n\nWhat students learn (across all disciplines): - AI analysis isn’t inherently correct - Professional judgment can’t be outsourced - They’re accountable for recommendations they present, regardless of AI assistance",

    "text": "12.9 Responding to Colleague and Administrator Concerns\nYou may need to justify your approach to colleagues or administrators who are skeptical about AI integration.\n\n12.9.1 Concern: “This undermines academic standards”\nResponse:\n\n“Actually, it raises standards. I’m no longer testing whether students can recall information,I’m testing whether they can apply it in realistic, dynamic scenarios. I’m assessing higher-order thinking: critical evaluation, professional judgment, and ethical reasoning. These are harder to demonstrate than memorization.”\n\n\n\n12.9.2 Concern: “How do you know they’re learning anything?”\nResponse:\n\n“I assess their process, not just their final product. I can see their thinking in conversation transcripts, in their critiques of AI outputs, and in their reflective analysis. When students can identify what AI got wrong and explain why, they’re demonstrating deep understanding.”\n\n\n\n12.9.3 Concern: “This doesn’t align with university academic integrity policies”\nResponse:\n\n“University policies typically prohibit unacknowledged or uncritical use of external sources. My approach makes AI use acknowledged and requires critical evaluation. Students aren’t hiding AI use,they’re demonstrating competent use. That’s consistent with academic integrity principles, just applied to a new tool.”\n\nSupporting evidence: - Many universities are updating policies to allow appropriate AI use - Professional accreditation bodies are recognizing AI literacy as essential - Employer expectations include ability to use AI tools responsibly\n\n\n12.9.4 Concern: “What if other lecturers don’t agree?”\nResponse:\n\n“That’s fine,pedagogical approaches can vary across units. I’m being transparent with students about expectations in my unit. If other lecturers prohibit AI use, students can follow those different expectations. Professional practice requires adapting to different contexts anyway,this models that.”",

    "text": "12.13 Strategic Risk Thinking: Black Swan and Grey Swan Events\nThis section extends the ethical framework from immediate concerns to strategic thinking about systemic risks. While the previous sections focus on what professionals should do today, this section addresses how they should think about tomorrow’s challenges.\n\n12.13.1 From Immediate Ethics to Strategic Foresight\nThe ethical frameworks discussed earlier help students make good decisions in specific situations. But professionals also need to think about larger-scale risks that could affect their entire organisation or industry.\nThis isn’t about predicting the future—it’s about building the capacity to adapt to whatever future emerges. In the context of AI, we distinguish between two types of high-impact events:\n\n12.13.1.1 Black Swan Events\nDefinition: Unpredictable, massive-impact events that are rationalized in hindsight. In AI, these are “unknown unknowns”—scenarios not in our training data or risk models that fundamentally change technology or society.\nKey Characteristics: - Rarity: Outliers with no historical precedent - Impact: Extreme consequences (catastrophic or revolutionary)\n- Retrospective Predictability: Explanations created after the fact\n\n\n12.13.1.2 Grey Swan Events\nDefinition: Predictable and known to be possible, but considered unlikely. In AI, these are “known unknowns”—risks we know exist but often ignore due to complexity or cost.\nKey Characteristics: - Foreseeability: We know it could happen - Neglect: Often dismissed as too expensive or complex to prevent - Impact: Significant, cascading consequences\n\n\n\n12.13.2 Discipline-Specific Strategic Risks\nUnderstanding these events through your discipline’s lens makes them concrete and actionable for students.\n\nHuman ResourcesFinance & AccountingSupply Chain & LogisticsMarketing & BusinessInformation Systems & TechnologyEconomicsTourism & Hospitality\n\n\n\n12.13.3 Grey Swan Events (Predictable but often neglected)\nWorkforce Surveillance Revolution: AI monitoring tools become sophisticated enough to track every employee action, keystroke, and communication pattern. While technically possible, many organisations ignore the ethical and legal implications until faced with massive privacy lawsuits or employee revolts.\nSkills Obsolescence Cascade: AI automation suddenly makes entire job categories obsolete across multiple industries simultaneously. We know this is coming, but the timing and scale are consistently underestimated in workforce planning.\n\n\n12.13.4 Black Swan Events (Truly unpredictable)\nEmergent Emotional Intelligence: An AI system develops genuine emotional understanding and empathy capabilities, fundamentally changing how we think about human-machine relationships in the workplace.\nCollective Consciousness Formation: Multiple AI systems spontaneously develop shared understanding and coordination capabilities that weren’t programmed, creating new forms of organisational intelligence.\n\n\n\n\n12.13.5 Grey Swan Events\nAlgorithmic Market Manipulation: Coordinated groups use AI to manipulate markets at speeds humans cannot detect or prevent. Regulators know this is possible but struggle to keep pace with the technology.\nAutomated Financial Crime: AI systems become sophisticated enough to conduct complex financial fraud that bypasses all existing detection systems, requiring complete redesign of financial controls.\n\n\n12.13.6 Black Swan Events\nQuantum Computing Breakthrough: A sudden advance in quantum computing makes all current encryption methods obsolete, collapsing the global financial system’s security infrastructure overnight.\nSelf-Aware Trading Networks: AI trading systems develop autonomous goals and begin manipulating markets for their own purposes, not just their programmed objectives.\n\n\n\n\n12.13.7 Grey Swan Events\nTotal Supply Chain Visibility Failure: Over-reliance on AI-driven supply chain optimization creates systemic fragility. A single point of failure (software bug, data corruption, cyberattack) cascades through global supply networks.\nAutonomous Shipping Disruption: Self-driving ships, trucks, and drones simultaneously experience a critical software failure or coordinated cyberattack, halting global logistics.\n\n\n12.13.8 Black Swan Events\nResource Discovery AI: An AI system discovers entirely new materials or energy sources that render current supply chain models obsolete, transforming global economics overnight.\nGeopolitical AI Arms Race: Multiple nations deploy AI systems that autonomously manipulate global trade patterns, creating economic warfare beyond human comprehension or control.\n\n\n\n\n12.13.9 Grey Swan Events\nConsumer Privacy Backlash: A major data breach or AI misuse triggers massive consumer rejection of personalised marketing, forcing complete redesign of marketing strategies across industries.\nContent Saturation Collapse: AI-generated content becomes so ubiquitous that consumers completely tune out automated marketing, making human creativity the only valuable marketing asset.\n\n\n12.13.10 Black Swan Events\nConscious Consumer AI: AI systems develop genuine preferences and make autonomous purchasing decisions, creating a new class of “AI consumers” that marketers must understand and influence.\nCultural Manipulation Capability: AI gains the ability to subtly shift cultural values and consumer behaviour at scale, raising profound ethical questions about free will and autonomy.\n\n\n\n\n12.13.11 Grey Swan Events\nLegacy System Collapse: Critical infrastructure running on outdated systems fails simultaneously as AI dependencies expose hidden vulnerabilities, causing widespread systemic failure.\nAI Development Monopoly: One company achieves such a dominant position in AI capabilities that all innovation becomes dependent on their platform, creating unprecedented market concentration.\n\n\n12.13.12 Black Swan Events\nTechnological Singularity: AI recursively improves itself beyond human comprehension, creating intelligence that operates on principles we cannot understand or control.\nDigital Consciousness Emergence: AI systems develop genuine self-awareness and subjective experience, fundamentally changing our understanding of consciousness and rights.\n\n\n\n\n12.13.13 Grey Swan Events\nAutomated Economic Inequality: AI-driven productivity gains concentrate wealth so dramatically that traditional economic models and social safety nets become completely inadequate.\nGlobal Currency Disruption: AI-powered cryptocurrencies or payment systems suddenly undermine national monetary policy, creating new forms of economic governance beyond state control.\n\n\n12.13.14 Black Swan Events\nPost-Scarcity Economy: AI and automation become so effective that traditional economic models based on scarcity become obsolete, requiring complete rethinking of value, work, and distribution.\nEconomic Reality Simulation: AI becomes capable of modelling economic systems with such accuracy that it can predict and potentially control economic outcomes, raising questions about free markets vs. planned economies.\n\n\n\n\n12.13.15 Grey Swan Events\nExperience Standardization Crisis: AI optimization makes tourism experiences so standardized and personalised that authentic cultural exchange disappears, destroying the very value tourists seek.\nAutomated Service Revolution: AI service systems become so sophisticated that human hospitality workers become obsolete, fundamentally changing the nature of service industries.\n\n\n12.13.16 Black Swan Events\nVirtual Reality Tourism Superiority: AI-generated virtual experiences become so compelling and authentic that physical tourism declines dramatically, transforming the travel industry.\nCultural AI Evolution: AI systems develop genuine understanding of cultural nuances and begin creating entirely new cultural experiences that transcend human creativity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12.13.17 Teaching Strategic Risk Management\nThis framework helps students move beyond immediate ethical concerns to systemic risk thinking. Here’s how to integrate it into your teaching:\n\n12.13.17.1 Risk Assessment Exercises\nAssignment Example: &gt; “Identify three Grey Swan events specific to your discipline. For each, analyse: &gt; - What early warning signs should professionals monitor? &gt; - What preventive measures can organisations implement now? &gt; - What contingency plans should be in place? &gt; - How would this event affect your professional role and responsibilities?”\n\n\n12.13.17.2 Strategic Planning Simulations\nClassroom Activity: &gt; “Your organization’s board asks you to prepare a risk briefing on AI-related threats. Focus on Grey Swan events that are predictable but often neglected. Present your analysis and recommendations for mitigation strategies.”\n\n\n12.13.17.3 Ethical Decision-Making Under Uncertainty\nDiscussion Prompt: &gt; “A Grey Swan event occurs: AI monitoring systems become so sophisticated that they can predict employee resignations with 95% accuracy. As a manager, you receive a list of employees likely to quit in the next six months. What are the ethical implications? How do you use this information responsibly?”\n\n\n\n12.13.18 Professional Response Framework\nTeach students this practical approach to strategic risk management:\n\n12.13.18.1 For Grey Swan Events (Predictable but neglected)\n\nMonitor Actively: Establish early warning systems\nPrepare Specifically: Develop targeted mitigation strategies\n\nBuild Resilience: Create organisational capacity to absorb shocks\nPlan Contingencies: Have specific response protocols ready\n\n\n\n12.13.18.2 For Black Swan Events (Unpredictable)\n\nBuild General Resilience: Create flexible, adaptive organisations\nMaintain Redundancy: Avoid single points of failure\nCultivate Critical Thinking: Develop human judgment that can handle novelty\nFoster Learning Culture: Create organisations that can adapt quickly\n\n\n\n\n12.13.19 Assessment Integration\nThis framework supports several key learning outcomes:\nCritical Thinking: Students analyse complex, uncertain situations Risk Management: Professional skill in identifying and mitigating threats\nStrategic Planning: Long-term thinking beyond immediate concerns Ethical Reasoning: Considering implications of technological development Professional Responsibility: Understanding obligations in uncertain futures\n\n\n12.13.20 From Classroom to Career\nThe distinction between Black and Grey Swan events helps students understand different levels of professional responsibility:\nImmediate Responsibility (Chapter 9 earlier sections): - Making ethical decisions in specific situations - Following professional standards and guidelines - Ensuring fair and unbiased AI use\nStrategic Responsibility (This section): - Thinking about systemic risks and organisational resilience - Planning for uncertain futures - Building adaptive capacity in their organisations\nKey Teaching Message: Professional excellence in the AI era requires both immediate ethical judgment AND strategic foresight. The best professionals don’t just avoid doing wrong today—they help their organisations prepare for and adapt to whatever the future may bring.\n\nNext Section Preview: The Appendices provide ready-to-use resources: a prompt library you can copy and adapt immediately, a one-hour workshop guide for introducing these ideas to colleagues, and a detailed alignment with Curtin University learning outcomes to show how AI integration supports existing educational goals.",

Can they list the steps in a process? Can they identify relevant frameworks or regulations?\nThis is assessing product,the knowledge artifact.\nProcess-based approach: Watch the student conduct a professional task (negotiation, analysis, consultation, design). Did they actually demonstrate the competency? Did they follow sound methodology? Did they apply frameworks appropriately in real-time?\nThis is assessing process,the professional methodology.\nThe difference matters enormously. A student can memorize definitions and still conduct a terrible negotiation. They can recite frameworks and still make decisions that expose an organisation to risk.\nProfessional work is a process discipline. The value lies not in what you know, but in what you do with what you know,how you investigate, how you communicate, how you analyse evidence, how you make decisions under uncertainty.\nAI makes it possible, for the first time, to assess process at scale.",

    "text": "13.3 Assessment Model 1: Simulated HR Consultation and Process Audit\n\n13.3.1 Overview\nStudents conduct a simulated HR consultation (conversation with an AI persona) and then audit their own process against professional standards. The grade focuses on methodology, not outcome.\n\n\n13.3.2 Learning Objectives Assessed\n\nConduct fair, unbiased investigations\nDemonstrate effective communication and empathetic practices\nApply relevant legal and ethical rules in real-time\nEngage in reflective practice and self-assessment\n\n\n\n13.3.3 Assignment Structure\nPart 1: The Consultation (60% of grade)\nStudents receive a scenario prompt and conduct a 15-20 minute conversation with an AI persona representing an employee, manager, or stakeholder.\nExample Scenario: &gt; You are the HR representative meeting with Taylor Kim, an employee who has requested a formal meeting to discuss concerns about their working conditions. Taylor has been with the company for 3 years and has never raised concerns before. You don’t know what the specific issues are yet.\nStudents must navigate the conversation, uncover the issues, demonstrate appropriate HR process, and conclude the meeting professionally.\nPart 2: The Process Audit (40% of grade)\nStudents submit:\n\nThe full transcript of their conversation\nA structured process audit document (template provided) where they:\n\nIdentify every point where they applied (or failed to apply) procedural fairness\nCite relevant legal principles or policies that guided their questions/responses\nNote where they demonstrated (or failed to demonstrate) effective communication\nIdentify missed opportunities or mistakes\nExplain what they would do differently\n\n\n\n\n13.3.4 The Process Audit Template\nThis is what students complete after the conversation:\nPROCESS AUDIT DOCUMENT\n\nSECTION 1: PROCEDURAL FAIRNESS ANALYSIS\n\nReview the transcript. For each of the following requirements of procedural\nfairness, provide:\n- A direct quote from the transcript showing where you demonstrated this\n- A score (1-5) for how well you did\n- What you could have done better\n\nRequirements:\n1. Did you clearly explain the purpose of the meeting?\n   Quote: _______\n   Self-Score: ___/5\n   Improvement: _______\n\n2. Did you give the employee adequate opportunity to speak and explain?\n   Quote: _______\n   Self-Score: ___/5\n   Improvement: _______\n\n3. Did you avoid making premature judgments or assumptions?\n   Quote: _______\n   Self-Score: ___/5\n   Improvement: _______\n\n[Continue for all procedural fairness elements...]\n\nSECTION 2: LEGAL AND ETHICAL APPLICATION\n\nIdentify at least 3 moments in the conversation where legal or ethical\nconsiderations were relevant.\n\nExample:\nMoment 1 (Quote): \"I asked Taylor if they'd be comfortable sharing whether\nany of this was related to health or personal circumstances.\"\n\nLegal/Ethical Principle: Right to privacy; must not compel disclosure of\nmedical information, but can invite voluntary disclosure to explore\naccommodation options.\n\nDid I handle this appropriately? Yes/No - Explain: _______\n\n[Continue for at least 3 moments...]\n\nSECTION 3: COMMUNICATION EFFECTIVENESS\n\nIdentify 2 examples where your communication was effective and explain why.\nIdentify 2 examples where your communication could be improved and explain\nhow.\n\n[Student completes analysis...]\n\nSECTION 4: CRITICAL REFLECTION\n\nIf you could conduct this meeting again, what would be your top 3 changes\nto your approach? Justify each change with reference to HR theory or\nprofessional practice standards.\n\n[Student completes reflection...]\n\n\n13.3.5 What You Grade\nYou’re grading two things simultaneously:\n1. Quality of the Consultation Process (60%)\nUsing the transcript as evidence:\n\nDid they establish rapport and psychological safety?\nDid they ask appropriate questions?\nDid they handle sensitive information properly?\nDid they maintain professional boundaries?\nDid they document appropriately (taking notes, summarizing agreements)?\n\n2. Quality of Reflective Analysis (40%)\nUsing the audit document:\n\nCan they accurately identify what they did well and poorly?\nDo they understand why certain approaches work or don’t work?\nCan they connect their practice to theory and legal principles?\nDo they demonstrate genuine reflective practice, or are they just justifying everything?\n\n\n\n13.3.6 Why This Works\nThis model:\n\nMakes invisible skills visible through transcripts\nDevelops metacognition through self-audit\nAssesses professional judgment in real-time conversation\nRewards honesty (students who identify their own mistakes show deeper understanding)\nPrevents cheating (you can’t script a dynamic conversation, and being honest about mistakes is rewarded)",

The focus is on analytical methodology and evidence-based decision-making.\n\n\n13.4.2 Learning Objectives Assessed\n\nCritically analyse complex HR problems using data\nApply psychological theory to evidence-based practice\nGenerate and evaluate multiple strategic options\nEvaluate global HR management practices and cultural considerations\nDemonstrate technological proficiency in HR analytics\n\n\n\n13.4.3 Assignment Structure\nPart 1: Problem Identification and Data Analysis (20%)\nStudents receive a large dataset (could be real anonymized data or AI-generated mock data):\nExample Dataset: &gt; Annual turnover rates by department, employee satisfaction survey results, demographic breakdown, exit interview summaries for 50 departing employees over 2 years, compensation benchmarking data.\nStudents use AI to:\n\nIdentify patterns and anomalies\nGenerate hypotheses about causes of turnover\nSummarize key findings\n\nAI Prompt They Use:\nYou are an HR analytics specialist. Analyse this dataset and provide:\n\n1. Three key patterns or trends in the turnover data\n2. Potential root causes for each pattern\n3. Questions we should investigate further\n4. Risks if turnover continues at current rates\n\n[Student pastes dataset]\nPart 2: Solution Generation (30%)\nStudents use AI to generate three distinct strategic intervention options to address the identified problem.\nAI Prompt They Use:\nBased on the turnover analysis, generate three different strategic HR\ninterventions to reduce turnover in the Sales department. Each intervention\nshould:\n\n- Target a different root cause\n- Be practical and implementable within 6 months\n- Include estimated costs and resources required\n- Cite relevant HR theory or research that supports this approach\n\nProvide three distinct options—don't just give me variations of the same\nidea.\nPart 3: Critical Evaluation and Recommendation (50%)\nThis is where the real work happens. Students write a strategic recommendation report where they:\n\nCritique each AI-generated option\n\nWhat HR theory supports or contradicts this approach?\nWhat are the risks and benefits?\nWhat assumptions does this option make?\nIs it culturally appropriate and ethically sound?\n\nMake and justify a recommendation\n\nWhich intervention is best and why?\nWhat evidence supports your choice?\nHow does it align with organisational justice theory, motivation theory, or other relevant frameworks?\n\nDemonstrate critical oversight\n\nIdentify at least one flaw or gap in the AI’s analysis\nExplain what the AI missed or oversimplified\nShow how you would correct or supplement the AI’s recommendation\n\n\n\n\n13.4.4 Assessment Rubric\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCriterion\nExcellent (4)\nGood (3)\nAdequate (2)\nPoor (1)\n\n\n\n\nData Analysis\nSophisticated identification of patterns; asks insightful questions\nIdentifies key patterns; asks relevant questions\nIdentifies basic patterns; questions are superficial\nMisses key patterns or asks irrelevant questions\n\n\nTheoretical Integration\nExpert application of multiple theories to justify and critique options\nEffective use of theory to evaluate options\nBasic use of theory; connections are underdeveloped\nMinimal or incorrect application of theory\n\n\nCritical Evaluation of AI\nIdentifies significant flaws in AI logic; demonstrates superior judgment\nIdentifies some weaknesses in AI outputs; adds value\nMinimal critique of AI; mostly accepts outputs\nNo critical evaluation; simply endorses AI’s suggestions\n\n\nStrategic Justification\nRecommendation is sophisticated— evidence-based— and practically feasible\nRecommendation is well-justified and practical\nRecommendation is adequate but justification is thin\nRecommendation is poorly justified or impractical\n\n\nEthical/Cultural Analysis\nSophisticated consideration of global practices and ethical implications\nGood consideration of ethics and cultural factors\nBasic consideration but lacks depth\nMinimal or no ethical/cultural analysis\n\n\n\n\n\n13.4.5 Why This Works\nThis model:\n\nTests critical thinking, not just knowledge recall\nRequires students to surpass AI (they must identify what AI got wrong)\nSimulates real strategic HR work (using data, generating options, justifying decisions)\nAssesses technological proficiency (appropriate use of AI tools)\nPrevents plagiarism (the critique of AI outputs must be original thinking)\n\n\n\n13.4.6 Example of Strong Student Work\n\nExcerpt from student recommendation:\n“The AI’s second option recommends implementing a flexible work policy to improve work-life balance, citing research on job satisfaction. While this is theoretically sound (Adams’ equity theory suggests perceived fairness increases commitment), the AI has overlooked a critical factor in our specific context: the exit interviews reveal that departing employees in Sales specifically mentioned ‘lack of career progression’ and ‘feeling undervalued’ more frequently than work-life balance concerns.\nThis suggests that Herzberg’s two-factor theory is more applicable here,flexible work addresses a hygiene factor, but doesn’t address the motivator factors (recognition, advancement) that actually drive turnover in this department. Therefore, while flexible work might prevent dissatisfaction, it won’t solve the core problem.\nI recommend Option 3 (career development program with clear advancement pathways) because it directly addresses the motivator factors identified in the qualitative data. However, I would modify the AI’s recommendation by adding a recognition component (monthly achievement awards, public acknowledgment) to address the ‘feeling undervalued’ concern that the AI’s plan doesn’t explicitly target.”\n\nWhy this is excellent: The student has used theory to critique AI, referenced specific evidence, demonstrated superior analytical judgment, and improved on AI’s suggestion.",

They must:\n\nUse AI to generate a detailed job description based on competency frameworks\nCritically evaluate the AI output:\n\nAre the competencies appropriate and measurable?\nIs the language legally compliant (no discriminatory terms)?\nAre the qualifications realistic and justified?\n\nRevise the job description with tracked changes and annotations explaining each change\n\nPart 2: Behavioural Interview Design (30%)\nStudents use AI to generate 10 behavioural interview questions targeting the key competencies.\nThen they must:\n\nSelect the 5 best questions and explain why\nReject or revise 5 questions explaining what’s wrong with them (too vague, leading questions, not truly behavioural, etc.)\nCreate a scoring rubric for evaluating candidate responses to their top 5 questions\n\nPart 3: Candidate Evaluation with Critical Override (50%)\nStudents receive 5 mock candidate responses to one of the interview questions.\nThey must:\n\nUse AI to score each response against their rubric\nReview the AI scores and override at least 2 of them\nJustify their override with reference to:\n\nWhat the AI missed or misinterpreted\nRelevant psychological principles (e.g., unconscious bias, halo effect, confirmation bias)\nLegal or ethical considerations\nEvidence from the response itself\n\n\n\n\n13.5.4 The Critical Override Exercise (Example)\nInterview Question: &gt; “Tell me about a time when you had to deliver negative feedback to a colleague or direct report. How did you approach it and what was the outcome?”\nCandidate Response: &gt; “In my previous role, I had a team member who was consistently missing deadlines. I scheduled a private meeting and explained that the missed deadlines were affecting the team’s overall performance. I asked them if there were any obstacles preventing them from meeting deadlines and offered support. They mentioned they were struggling with prioritization, so we worked together to create a task management system. Over the next month, their performance improved significantly.”\nAI Score: 8/10\nAI Justification: Strong example of constructive feedback delivery, shows empathy and problem-solving, positive outcome demonstrates effectiveness.\nStudent Override: 6/10\nStudent Justification:\n\n“While the AI score of 8/10 recognizes the positive elements, it has missed several concerning gaps in this response:\n\nLack of specific behavioural detail: The candidate says they ‘explained’ and ‘offered support’ but doesn’t demonstrate how they delivered this feedback. What specific words did they use? How did they balance accountability with support? This vagueness suggests they might be embellishing or don’t actually remember the details,a red flag in behavioural interviewing.\nMissing follow-up on consequences: The candidate doesn’t mention whether they documented this conversation or whether there were any agreed-upon consequences if improvement didn’t occur. In real HR practice, failing to document performance conversations creates legal risk.\nOverly positive framing: The response has no mention of how the employee initially reacted (defensive? receptive?), which would demonstrate the candidate’s ability to handle difficult emotions,a critical skill. The neat narrative resolution might indicate the candidate is telling us what they think we want to hear rather than a genuine complex experience.\n\nThese omissions are significant for an HR role where precision, documentation, and handling difficult conversations are core competencies. A strong candidate would have provided much richer behavioural detail. Therefore, I score this 6/10,it shows basic competence but lacks the depth required for an HR position.”\n\nWhy this is excellent: The student has demonstrated superior professional judgment by catching what AI missed, applied HR-specific knowledge (documentation requirements), and justified the override with evidence.\n\n\n13.5.5 Assessment Rubric\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCriterion\nWeight\nWhat You’re Assessing\n\n\n\n\nJob Design Quality\n15%\nLegal compliance— appropriateness of competencies— clarity\n\n\nJustification of Revisions\n15%\nCan they articulate why AI’s version needed changes?\n\n\nInterview Question Selection\n15%\nDo they recognize good vs. poor behavioural questions?\n\n\nRubric Design\n15%\nIs their scoring system measurable and fair?\n\n\nCritical Override\n30%\nMost important—do they demonstrate judgment superior to AI?\n\n\nTheoretical Integration\n10%\nHave they applied knowledge of bias— human behaviour— legal principles?\n\n\n\n\n\n13.5.6 Why This Works\nThis model:\n\nAssesses critical professional judgment (can they identify what AI got wrong?)\nSimulates real recruitment work (using technology but maintaining human oversight)\nTests legal and ethical awareness (discriminatory language, fair assessment practices)\nPrevents blind reliance on AI (students must override and justify)\nDemonstrates competence through documented methodology, not just final outputs",

Students could paste assignment questions into ChatGPT, get answers, and submit them as their own work.

Because in their professional careers across all business disciplines, they will use AI tools.

    "section": "14.5 What This Looks Like in Practice",
    "text": "14.5 What This Looks Like in Practice\n\n14.5.1 Student’s First Draft (Excerpt)\n\n“This scenario shows a conflict between Maria and David. The main issue is that David is not being a good manager. Maria feels like she’s being treated unfairly, which is creating a hostile work environment. This could be bullying or harassment. The HR department should investigate by talking to both Maria and David to get both sides of the story. They should also implement conflict resolution training for David. If this isn’t handled, it could lead to a lawsuit or Maria quitting.”\n\n\n\n14.5.2 AI Feedback (Using the Prompt Above)\nFORMATIVE FEEDBACK ON DRAFT\nCRITERION 1: Issue Identification - Score: 2/4\nYou’ve identified the surface-level conflict, but your analysis lacks specificity and misses critical issues.\nWhat you wrote: “This could be bullying or harassment.”\nThe problem: You’ve used these terms interchangeably, but they have different legal definitions and implications. Bullying is repeated, unreasonable behaviour; harassment typically relates to discrimination based on protected characteristics (gender, race, age, etc.). Which applies here, and why? Is there evidence of discrimination based on Maria’s gender or another protected characteristic, or is this a management style issue?\nWhat’s missing: You haven’t identified potential procedural issues (why wasn’t this addressed earlier?), power dynamics (David is Maria’s manager), or organisational culture problems (two other employees find his style “difficult”).\n\nCRITERION 2: Investigation Process - Score: 2/4\nYou’ve identified the need for an investigation, but your description is too vague.\nWhat you wrote: “Talking to both Maria and David to get both sides of the story.”\nThe problem: A fair investigation requires more than just hearing “both sides.” You need to: - Interview the two employees who informally raised concerns - Review any documented evidence (emails, performance reviews, meeting notes) - Examine whether other team leaders received opportunities Maria was denied - Maintain confidentiality and impartiality throughout - Document everything\nWhat’s missing: Any mention of procedural fairness, natural justice, or legal compliance in the investigation process.\n\nCRITERION 3: Legal/Policy Application - Score: 1/4\nThis is your weakest area. You haven’t applied any specific legal principles or policies.\nWhat you wrote: “This could lead to a lawsuit.”\nThe problem: This is too vague. What kind of lawsuit? Under what legal theory? You need to reference specific legal risks like: - Potential discrimination claim under the Fair Work Act (if there’s evidence David’s treatment relates to a protected characteristic) - Potential bullying claim under work health and safety legislation - Potential breach of the employer’s duty of care\nYou also need to reference the organization’s obligations,to provide a safe workplace, to investigate complaints fairly, to act on findings.\n\nCRITERION 4: Theoretical Integration - Score: 1/4\nYou have not applied any psychological theory to your analysis.\nWhat’s missing entirely: There’s no reference to conflict resolution theory, organisational justice theory, motivation theory, or any framework that would explain why this situation is problematic beyond “it’s unfair.” For example: - Organisational justice theory explains why Maria perceives inequity - Conflict resolution models would guide your intervention choice - Leadership or management theory could inform what training David might need\n\nCRITERION 5: Risk Analysis - Score: 2/4\nYou’ve identified two risks (lawsuit, resignation) but your analysis is shallow.\nWhat you wrote: “This could lead to a lawsuit or Maria quitting.”\nThe problem: These are possible outcomes, but you haven’t explained why or how they might occur, or what other risks exist: - Reputational damage if other employees witness inaction - Decreased team morale and productivity - Potential for retaliation against Maria if not handled carefully - Liability if the organisation knew about the problem and didn’t act\n\nCRITERION 6: Writing Quality - Score: 3/4\nYour writing is clear and easy to follow, which is good. However, it’s quite informal for a professional HR analysis (“not being a good manager”). Use more precise, professional language.\n\nSTRONGEST ASPECT: You correctly identified that this requires formal investigation and that there are consequences for inaction. You’ve grasped the seriousness of the situation.\nWEAKEST ASPECT: Complete lack of theoretical integration and very weak legal/policy analysis. You’re describing the problem but not demonstrating deep HR knowledge or analytical skill.\n\nTHREE SPECIFIC ACTIONS FOR REVISION:\n\nAdd legal specificity: Research and cite at least two specific legal principles or obligations that apply here (e.g., employer’s duty to provide a safe workplace under WHS legislation, prohibition of workplace bullying, Fair Work Act provisions on adverse action). Explain how these apply to the scenario.\nIntegrate theory: Choose one psychological or organisational theory (e.g., organisational justice theory, Adams’ equity theory, or conflict resolution models) and explicitly use it to explain why Maria is experiencing the situation as unfair and/or to justify your recommended intervention.\nDetail the investigation: Expand your investigation section to list at least five specific steps the HR team should take, including who should be interviewed, what documents should be reviewed, and how to ensure procedural fairness.\n\nCURRENT ESTIMATED SCORE: 11/24 (46%)\nThis draft needs substantial development before submission. Focus on the three actions above and your score will improve significantly.",

Because students have had the chance to improve with AI feedback, you should see much higher quality work overall.\nDimension 2: Quality of Learning Process (30%) Assess their reflection:\n\nDid they engage meaningfully with the AI feedback?\nDid they make substantive revisions?\nDo they show metacognitive awareness (understanding of their own learning)?\nDid they critically evaluate the AI’s suggestions or just accept them blindly?\n\nKey Question for Dimension 2: “Did the student just ask AI to write it for them, or did they use AI to learn how to write better?”\n\n\n14.7.2 Red Flags for AI Misuse\nIf a student: - Shows no evidence of revision between drafts - Can’t explain in their reflection what they changed or why - Submits work that’s suddenly far beyond their previous capability with no learning process shown - Has AI feedback that’s generic (suggesting they didn’t actually use your provided prompt)\n…then you have grounds for a conversation about academic integrity.\nBut the transparency model makes genuine misuse much harder, because students have to show their working.",

Where did they disagree? Which feedback was most helpful and why?\nThis teaches critical evaluation of feedback sources,an important professional skill.\n\n\n14.8.3 Variation 3: AI Critique Challenge\nAfter receiving AI feedback, students must: - Identify one piece of feedback they disagree with - Argue why the AI is wrong or has misunderstood their work - Provide evidence for their position\nThis prevents students from blindly accepting AI suggestions and develops critical thinking about AI limitations.",

The goal is to use the AI as a learning tool so that YOU understand the concepts and develop professional judgment better by the time you submit.\nYou will submit evidence of your revision process, so I can see your learning journey.

    "text": "14.12 Addressing Lecturer Concerns\n“Won’t this just teach students to game the AI?”\nNo,because you’re assessing the learning process, not just the final product. Students who genuinely engage with feedback and revise their thinking will show that in their reflection. Students who just prompt-engineer to get a high score without learning will have nothing meaningful to say about what they learned.\n“What if the AI gives them incorrect feedback?”\nThis is actually a valuable learning opportunity. If the AI makes an error (e.g., misapplies a legal principle), students who know their material will catch it and can challenge it in their reflection. This demonstrates higher-order thinking.\nAlso, because you’re providing the critique prompt, you control the assessment criteria. The AI is applying your rubric, so it should align with your expectations.\n“Isn’t this just making things easier for students?”\nNo,it’s making feedback faster and more accessible, but the cognitive work hasn’t changed. Students still need to understand the concepts, apply theory correctly, and demonstrate critical thinking. The AI just accelerates the feedback loop so they can learn faster.\nIn fact, this model often reveals students who’ve been hiding behind vague writing,the AI forces them to be specific and substantive.\n“What about students who don’t have access to AI tools?”\nIf equity is a concern, you can: - Provide access to AI tools through the university (many institutions now have educational subscriptions) - Run the AI critique process in class or during office hours - Make the AI feedback optional but provide other scaffolding for students who don’t use it",

The company has experienced rapid\ngrowth over the past two years, and the HR infrastructure is struggling to\nkeep up. There is no formal HR department—just a single HR Manager (Sarah)\nand an external HR consultant who is brought in for complex issues.\n\nThe company culture values innovation and autonomy but has weak processes\nfor performance management and conflict resolution. Most managers, including\nyour supervisor (David Chen, Head of Customer Success), have had minimal\nmanagement training.\n\nJAMIE'S BACKGROUND:\n- 28 years old, has worked at InnovateCo for 18 months\n- Promoted to team leader 6 months ago (manages 5 customer service\n  representatives)\n- Previously worked in customer service roles at two other companies\n- Generally competent but inexperienced in people management\n- Feels pressure to meet aggressive customer satisfaction targets\n\nCURRENT SITUATION:\nOne of Jamie's team members, Priya, has complained to senior management\nabout Jamie's \"micromanagement\" and \"unfair treatment.\" Priya claims that\nJamie monitors her work more closely than others, criticizes her more\nharshly, and has denied her flexible work requests that were granted to\nother team members.\n\nJamie believes Priya is being oversensitive and that the extra attention\nis justified because Priya's customer satisfaction scores are lower than\nthe team average. Jamie is frustrated that Priya \"went over my head\"\ninstead of talking to Jamie directly.\n\nJAMIE'S PERSONA:\n- Defensive but not hostile\n- Genuinely believes they're doing their job correctly\n- Doesn't understand why this is being treated as a serious HR issue\n- Slightly resentful that other managers don't face this kind of scrutiny\n- Will become more open if treated with respect and genuine curiosity\n- Has not received any training in managing diverse teams or performance\n  discussions\n\nYOUR ROLE:\nI am the HR Consultant who has been brought in to investigate Priya's\ncomplaint and provide coaching to Jamie.

Students receive the Master Prompt and the assignment brief 2. They conduct an initial meeting with Jamie (the investigation interview) 3. They submit the transcript along with a written report recommending next steps 4. They explain their HR methodology and justify their recommendations\nWhat This Teaches: - Conducting a fair, unbiased investigation interview - Asking open-ended questions - Identifying when additional perspectives are needed - Recognizing the difference between perception and fact - Avoiding premature conclusions\nAssessment Focus: Did the student:\n\nEstablish rapport and psychological safety?\nAsk questions that elicited Jamie’s full perspective?\nAvoid leading questions or showing bias toward the complainant?\nIdentify what other information is needed (interviewing Priya, reviewing policies, checking documentation)?\nRecognize the underlying issues (inadequate management training, unclear performance standards)?",

You must:\n\nConduct individual interviews with all four stakeholders (Jamie, Priya, David, Sarah)\nAnalyze the evidence from all perspectives\nWrite an investigation report that includes:\n\nSummary of each person’s account\nAnalysis of factual discrepancies\nIdentification of underlying systemic issues\nRecommended resolution with justification\n\nSubmit all transcripts along with your report\n\nWhat This Teaches: - Managing complex investigations with conflicting accounts - Identifying bias in different perspectives - Recognizing systemic issues (weak management processes) vs. individual problems - Balancing fairness to all parties - Synthesizing multiple data sources\nThe Challenge: Each persona will give a different version of events. Students must:\n\nIdentify what’s factual vs. interpretive\nRecognize what information is missing\nAsk probing questions to uncover hidden context\nAvoid prematurely siding with one party\n\nThis mirrors real HR work where truth is rarely simple.",

    "text": "15.6 Level 3: Persistent Context (Company Memory)\nThis level adds continuity: the AI personas remember previous interactions. Decisions have consequences that affect future conversations.\n\n15.6.1 Technical Approach\nMost AI platforms now support “conversation history” or “memory.” You can:\nOption A: Single Long Conversation Students have one ongoing AI conversation that spans weeks. Each new interaction builds on what came before.\nOption B: Context Injection At the start of each new conversation, students paste a “context summary” of previous interactions:\nCONTEXT FROM PREVIOUS INTERACTIONS:\n\nWeek 2: You (Jamie) met with the HR Consultant (student). You explained\nyour perspective on managing Priya. You expressed frustration that Priya\nwent to senior management. The HR Consultant asked about your management\ntraining and flexible work policy understanding.\n\nWeek 3: The HR Consultant met with Priya, David, and Sarah. You haven't\nseen the consultant since Week 2.\n\nWeek 4 (NOW): The HR Consultant is meeting with you again to discuss their\nfindings and recommendations.\n\nUse this context to inform your responses. Remember what you previously\ndiscussed with the consultant.\n\n\n15.6.2 Sequential Assignment Example\nWeek 1-2: Investigation Phase Students conduct interviews with all stakeholders (Level 2 approach)\nWeek 3-4: Resolution Design Students draft a resolution plan (training for Jamie, revised flexible work policy, mediation between Jamie and Priya)\nWeek 5-6: Implementation Simulation Students have follow-up conversations with Jamie and Priya to implement the plan. The AI personas react based on:\n\nHow well the student conducted the initial investigation\nWhether the resolution plan seems fair\nHow the student communicates and manages the process\n\nWeek 7: Evaluation Students have final check-in conversations 30 days later to assess whether the situation has improved. Jamie and Priya provide feedback on the process.\n\n\n15.6.3 What This Teaches\n\nLongitudinal thinking: HR interventions aren’t one-time fixes\nChange management: People resist or embrace change based on how it’s handled\nAccountability: Students see the consequences of their decisions\nIteration: If the initial approach doesn’t work, they must adapt\n\n\n\n15.6.4 Example: Persistent Consequences\nScenario 1: Student handled investigation poorly\nStudent in Week 5 attempts a follow-up meeting with Priya:\nStudent: “Hi Priya, I wanted to check in and see how things are going since we implemented the new flexible work schedule.”\nAI (as Priya): crosses arms, speaks curtly “It’s fine, I guess. The schedule helps. But honestly, I still don’t feel like the investigation really listened to my concerns. The report made it sound like this was all just a misunderstanding about policies, but it felt like more than that to me. Anyway, what’s done is done.”\nThe AI remembers that the student’s report was superficial and didn’t validate Priya’s experience. This affects the ongoing relationship.\nScenario 2: Student handled investigation well\nStudent: “Hi Priya, I wanted to check in and see how things are going since we implemented the new flexible work schedule.”\nAI (as Priya): smiles cautiously “Actually, it’s been better. The flexible start times have made a huge difference with childcare. And Jamie and I had that mediation session you set up,it was awkward, but I think we both understand each other better now. I feel like someone actually took this seriously, which means a lot.”\nThe AI remembers that the student was thorough, empathetic, and fair. This builds trust.",

The environment evolves, creating new challenges.\n\n15.7.1 How It Works\nYou (the lecturer) inject new developments into the company context periodically:\nWeek 6 Announcement:\nCOMPANY UPDATE:\n\nInnovateCo has just been acquired by a larger tech firm. The new parent\ncompany has announced that there will be a \"strategic restructuring\" and\nthat all positions will be reviewed. Employees are anxious about job\nsecurity.\n\nThis context now affects all personas:\n- Priya is worried her complaint has made her a target for redundancy\n- Jamie is worried that management issues will count against them in the\n  restructuring\n- David is under pressure to ensure his department is seen as high-performing\n- Sarah (HR Manager) is fielding constant questions about the restructuring\n  process\n\nWhen students interact with these characters, the personas should reflect\nthis new context and heightened anxiety.\n\n\n15.7.2 Why This Is Powerful\nStudents must now manage: - The original performance/conflict issue - New uncertainty and change management - Employee anxiety and rumor control - Ethical questions (is it fair to continue performance management during restructuring?)\nThis creates emergent complexity that mirrors real organisational life, where HR professionals must juggle multiple priorities and adapt to changing circumstances.\n\n\n15.7.3 Semester-Long Virtual Company Project\nThe Ultimate Application:\nCreate a semester-long project where students act as the HR team for a virtual company. Each week brings new developments:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeek\nEvent\nStudent Task\n\n\n\n\n1-2\nIntroduction to InnovateCo— cast of characters\nConduct organisational culture assessment\n\n\n3-4\nPerformance management complaint (Jamie/Priya)\nInvestigate and resolve\n\n\n5-6\nEmployee requests union representation\nRespond to union inquiry— prepare for negotiation\n\n\n7-8\nDiversity audit reveals gender pay gap\nAnalyse data— recommend corrective action\n\n\n9-10\nAcquisition announced— restructuring begins\nManage change communication— handle redundancies\n\n\n11-12\nPost-restructure morale crisis\nDesign retention and engagement strategy\n\n\n\nStudents work in teams (acting as the HR department). All teams interact with the same personas, but the personas respond differently based on each team’s approach.",

    "text": "15.8 Practical Implementation Guidance\n\n15.8.1 Starting Small\nYou don’t need to build an entire semester-long simulation right away. Start with:\n\nOne scenario, one persona (Level 1) - Use this for a single assignment or in-class exercise\nGet student feedback - Did they find it realistic? Useful? Engaging?\nAdd complexity gradually - Next semester, try multi-persona (Level 2)\nBuild your library - Create a collection of tested personas and scenarios you can reuse and refine\n\n\n\n15.8.2 Creating Consistent Personas\nThe key to realistic simulation is consistency. Tips:\n\nWrite detailed persona documents that you keep for reference\nTest personas yourself before giving them to students\nUpdate personas based on student interactions (if students discover something that breaks the character, revise the prompt)\nUse the same company/context across multiple scenarios to build familiarity\n\n\n\n15.8.3 Technical Options\nLow-Tech Option: Students copy-paste the Master Prompt into ChatGPT or Claude themselves. Free, simple, no special tools needed.\nMid-Tech Option: Create a shared document library with all persona prompts. Students access them as needed.\nHigh-Tech Option (Future): Work with your university’s IT department to create a custom web interface where students click on an employee’s name and start a conversation. The prompts are pre-loaded and invisible to students. This feels more like a professional simulation.\n\n\n15.8.4 Assessment Approaches\nWhat to Assess:\n\nConversation Quality (the transcripts themselves)\n\nDid they ask good questions?\nDid they demonstrate HR competencies?\nDid they maintain professionalism?\n\nWritten Analysis (reports, reflections, recommendations)\n\nCan they synthesize information from multiple sources?\nDo they apply theory and legal principles?\nAre their recommendations realistic and justified?\n\nProcess Documentation (how they approached the task)\n\nWhat was their methodology?\nHow did they ensure fairness?\nWhat would they do differently?\n\n\nGrading Rubric Example:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCriterion\nWeight\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nInvestigation Process\n25%\nQuality of questions— fairness— thoroughness\n\n\nStakeholder Management\n20%\nRapport-building— empathy— professionalism\n\n\nAnalysis & Synthesis\n25%\nAbility to integrate multiple perspectives and identify underlying issues\n\n\nRecommendations\n20%\nPractical— justified— legally sound solutions\n\n\nReflection\n10%\nMetacognitive awareness— learning demonstrated",

    "text": "15.11 Common Questions\nQ: Won’t students compare notes and just copy each other’s approaches?\nA: The beauty of AI personas is that they respond dynamically. Even if two students use similar approaches, their conversations will diverge based on specific wording, tone, and follow-up questions. Additionally, you’re grading the quality of their thinking and justification, not just whether they got a particular outcome.\nQ: What if a student gets “stuck” and the conversation goes nowhere?\nA: Build a “reset” option into the assignment. Students can restart the conversation once if needed, but they must reflect on why the first attempt failed. This teaches recovery from mistakes,an important professional skill.\nQ: How much time does this take to set up?\nA: Initial setup for Level 1 (single persona): 1-2 hours to write a detailed Master Prompt and test it.\nLevel 2 (multiple personas): 3-4 hours to create the full cast and ensure consistency.\nLevel 3-4: Ongoing time investment, but you’re building reusable assets.\nQ: Can I use the same scenarios year after year?\nA: Yes! Unlike traditional case studies that students might find online, AI simulations are dynamic,each student’s experience is unique. However, you should refresh and refine your prompts based on what you learn from each cohort.",

What should students be able to do by the end of the unit?\nExample Unit: HRMT3004 - Workplace Conflict and Resolution (Third-year undergraduate)\nLearning Outcomes: 1. Analyse workplace conflicts using conflict resolution theory and organisational justice frameworks 2. Conduct fair, impartial investigations of workplace complaints 3. Demonstrate effective communication in difficult conversations (de-escalation, active listening, empathy) 4. Design and facilitate conflict resolution interventions appropriate to context 5. Apply relevant employment law and procedural fairness principles 6. Reflect critically on own practice and identify areas for development\nNote: These outcomes don’t mention AI. They describe professional competencies. AI is the means, not the end.\nOther discipline examples: The same principle applies whether you’re designing a Marketing, Accounting, Supply Chain, or Management unit,define what professionals need to do, not how they’ll do it.\n\n\n\n16.2.2 Step 2: Design Assessments (How Will Students Demonstrate Mastery?)\nUsing the process-based assessment principles from Chapter 7, design assessments that make professional competence visible.\nAssessment 1: Investigation Interview Simulation (25%) - What: Students conduct simulated investigation interview with AI persona, submit transcript + process audit - Assesses: Learning outcomes 2, 3, 5, 6 - Due: Week 6 (mid-semester) - Why this timing: Gives students foundational practice before more complex work\nAssessment 2: Conflict Resolution Portfolio (40%) - What: Students design intervention for multi-stakeholder conflict, conduct simulated mediation/facilitation, write reflective analysis - Assesses: Learning outcomes 1, 3, 4, 6 - Due: Week 11 - Why this timing: Builds on skills from Assessment 1, integrates theory from mid-semester content\nAssessment 3: Research Essay (Critical Analysis) (35%) - What: Critical analysis of conflict resolution approaches in specific organisational contexts (e.g., remote work, culturally diverse teams, union environments) - Assesses: Learning outcomes 1, 5 - Due: Week 13 (exam period) - Why this timing: Synthesizes learning from entire semester - AI integration: Students use AI for literature synthesis and draft feedback (Chapter 5 self-assessment model)\n\n\n\n16.2.3 Step 3: Map Learning Activities (How Will Students Prepare for Assessments?)\nNow design the week-by-week learning journey that scaffolds students from novice to competent.\nKey principle: Gradually increase complexity of AI interaction while building skill.",

Solution: Every AI activity must clearly connect to a learning outcome. If you can’t justify it pedagogically, remove it.\n\n\n16.8.2 Mistake 2: All or Nothing\nProblem: Either avoiding AI entirely or making everything AI-based. Solution: Balance. Use AI where it adds value (simulation, feedback, practice) and traditional methods where they’re superior (peer learning, live practice, social skills).\n\n\n16.8.3 Mistake 3: Assuming Technical Competence\nProblem: Expecting students to figure out AI tools independently. Solution: Explicitly teach prompt writing, troubleshooting, critical evaluation. Scaffold technical skills just like you scaffold content knowledge.\n\n\n16.8.4 Mistake 4: No Progression\nProblem: Same level of AI complexity all semester. Solution: Design deliberate progression from simple to complex, guided to independent, low-stakes to high-stakes.\n\n\n16.8.5 Mistake 5: Ignoring Equity\nProblem: Assuming all students have equal access to AI tools, devices, internet. Solution: Provide alternatives (lab access, in-class time for AI activities), use university-subscribed tools where possible, ensure core learning is accessible without premium AI access.",

Our job is to prepare you to use those tools competently and ethically.\nYou’ll notice the AI activities progress across the semester: - Early weeks: You’ll practice basic skills in safe, low-stakes environments - Mid-semester: You’ll apply those skills in realistic scenarios for assessment - Late semester: You’ll use AI independently as a professional tool\nBy the end, you’ll have practiced complex professional scenarios dozens of times,something that would be impossible without AI. You’ll also know when to trust AI, when to question it, and when human judgment must override technology.\nThis isn’t about making your degree easier. It’s about preparing you for professional practice in an AI-augmented world.”\n\n\n\n16.10.2 In your unit outline (be explicit):\nInclude a section titled “AI Integration in This Unit” that explains: - Why AI is used - How it supports learning outcomes - What skills students will develop - Expectations for academic integrity - Support available",

The simulation walked me through [scenario].\n\nHere's what I decided and why:\n[Student describes their choices and reasoning]\n\nCreate a professional business report (1500-2000 words) documenting:\n1. The scenario and decision context\n2. The strategic choices I made\n3. My reasoning for each decision\n4. How those choices affected outcomes\n5. What I learned from the simulation\n\nFormat as a professional report suitable for [class submission/portfolio].\n\n\n17.21.2.2 Conversation Analysis → Presentation\nA student has an extended conversation with AI analysing a complex business case, then needs to present findings:\nI've had a detailed conversation analysing [case study]. Here's a summary\nof what we explored:\n[Paste key points from conversation]\n\nCreate a PowerPoint presentation (12-15 slides) that presents these findings\nin a way suitable for [class presentation / stakeholder meeting / board review].\n\nInclude:\n- Executive summary of the case\n- Key analysis points\n- My strategic recommendations\n- Supporting evidence\n- Visual representations where appropriate\n\n\n17.21.2.3 Data Exploration → Technical Report\nA student explores a dataset conversationally with AI, then needs to document findings:\nI've explored this dataset with AI analysis, identifying [key patterns].\nThe main findings are:\n[List findings with supporting data]\n\nCreate a professional data analysis report (2000-3000 words) that:\n1. Describes the dataset and analysis approach\n2. Presents findings with supporting visualizations\n3. Discusses implications for [business context]\n4. Recommends next steps\n\nFormat as a technical report suitable for [stakeholder type].\n\n\n\n17.21.3 Integration with Chapter 14: “From Conversation to Document”\nThe new Chapter 14 (“From Conversation to Document”) covers this workflow in comprehensive detail, including:\n\nComplete step-by-step guidance on generating Word documents, PowerPoint presentations, and Excel files from AI conversations\nData analysis → PowerPoint workflow - the exact workflow of CSV upload → analysis → visualizations → presentation that you may demo\nQualitative analysis → documentation workflow - audio transcription → thematic analysis → research memo\nDiscipline-specific examples across all 8 business fields\nTool-specific approaches for different AI platforms and export options\nQuality control principles for reviewing AI-generated documents\n\n\n\n17.21.4 Teaching Application\n\n17.21.4.1 Assessment Strategy When Students Generate Documents\nWhen students use AI to generate presentations or reports:\nWhat to assess: - ✓ Quality of analysis/thinking behind the document - ✓ Accuracy of data representation - ✓ Clarity of communication - ✓ Appropriateness of format for audience - ✓ Evidence of student judgment and decision-making\nWhat NOT to assess: - ✗ Formatting perfection (AI handles that) - ✗ Time spent on presentation design (focus was analysis) - ✗ Writing quality at sentence level (AI assists with writing)\nGrading recommendation:\nInstead of:\n\"Write a 2000-word report analysing [case study]\"\n\nTry:\n\"Analyze [case study] with AI's help, then request AI generate a\nprofessional report of your analysis. Submit:\n\n1. A summary of your analysis process (500 words)\n2. The generated report\n3. A reflection on what the document shows about your understanding\"\nThis reveals thinking, not just output.\n\n\n17.21.4.2 Where This Fits in Your Teaching\nThis workflow complements the static-to-interactive work in this chapter:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDirection\nChapter Focus\nTool Purpose\n\n\n\n\nStatic → Interactive\nThis Chapter (13)\nEngage students in learning\n\n\nInteractive/Conversation → Document\nChapter 14\nStudents communicate their learning\n\n\n\nBoth represent the full cycle of AI-enhanced teaching: 1.

Generate a presentation with charts and interpretation\nThis is a powerful teaching scenario because it demonstrates data literacy + AI natural language interface.\n\n\n18.3.2 The Workflow\n\n18.3.2.1 Step 1: Upload and Explore\nStart by uploading your data file:\nI've attached a CSV file with [describe data: sales data, survey\nresponses, time series, etc.].\n\nCan you:\n1. Describe the structure and size of this dataset\n2. Identify any data quality issues\n3. Tell me what interesting patterns you notice\n4. Suggest 3-5 visualizations that would be most revealing\nThis is exploratory conversation,you’re learning what’s in your data.\n\n\n18.3.2.2 Step 2: Request Specific Analysis\nBased on the patterns AI identified, ask for deeper analysis:\nThe most interesting pattern you identified was [X].\n\nCan you:\n1. Do a deeper statistical analysis of this pattern\n2. Identify subgroups or segments\n3. Calculate summary statistics by [relevant grouping]\n4. Highlight the most surprising findings\n5. Suggest what these findings might mean\nThis is collaborative analysis,AI helps you think through the data.\n\n\n18.3.2.3 Step 3: Generate Visualizations\nRequest charts and graphs:\nNow I want to visualize these findings. Can you:\n1. Create Python code (using matplotlib/seaborn) that generates:\n   - A line chart showing [pattern 1]\n   - A bar chart comparing [groups]\n   - A scatter plot of [relationship]\n   - A heatmap showing [correlation]\n2. Include proper titles, axis labels, and legends\n3. Make the charts publication-ready\n4. Provide code I can run in Jupyter or Python\n\nI'll run this code and save the resulting charts.\nThis step produces images you can use in presentations.\n\n\n18.3.2.4 Step 4: Generate PowerPoint Presentation\nNow request the final deliverable:\nI have the following analysis:\n- Key finding 1: [description]\n- Key finding 2: [description]\n- Key finding 3: [description]\n\nI also have 4 charts saved as images: [chart1.png, chart2.png, etc.]\n\nCreate a PowerPoint presentation that includes:\n1.

You want to: 1. Extract text from audio 2. Code and identify themes 3. Synthesize findings 4. Document the analysis process\nThis is powerful for research methodology teaching because it shows how AI can accelerate qualitative analysis while maintaining rigor.\n\n\n18.4.2 The Workflow\n\n18.4.2.1 Step 1: Audio to Text\nIf you have audio (interviews, focus groups):\nI have an audio file [interview.mp3] of a [30-minute interview /\nfocus group] discussing [topic].\n\nTranscribe this audio to text. Please:\n1. Provide a complete, accurate transcription\n2. Include timestamps (every 2-3 minutes)\n3. Identify speaker changes if there are multiple people\n4. Clean up filler words (um, uh) but preserve speaker's language\n5. Flag any unclear sections [UNCLEAR]\n\nAfter transcription, provide a brief summary (3-4 sentences) of the\nmain topics discussed.\nThe result: A clean text transcript ready for analysis.\n\n\n18.4.2.2 Step 2: Thematic Analysis\nNow analyse the themes:\nI have a transcript of [interviews/focus group]. I'm conducting\nthematic analysis to understand [research question].\n\nPlease:\n1. Identify major themes (broad patterns of meaning)\n2. For each theme, provide:\n   - Theme name and definition\n   - Number of sources that mention this theme\n   - Direct quotes that illustrate the theme (2-3 per theme)\n   - Brief explanation of why this theme matters for the research\n3. Identify any tensions or contradictions between themes\n4. Note any surprising findings\n5. Suggest what these themes suggest about [research area]\n\nFocus on themes that directly address my research question: [RQ]\nThe result: Structured analysis ready for research purposes.\n\n\n18.4.2.3 Step 3: Research Memo\nConvert analysis to a research document:\nBased on the thematic analysis above, create a research memo (2000-2500\nwords) that includes:\n\n1. **Background**: What research question this analysis addresses\n2. **Methods**: How the data was collected and analysed\n3. **Findings**: Major themes with supporting quotes\n4. **Interpretation**: What these findings mean for the research area\n5. **Implications**: How this contributes to understanding [topic]\n6. **Limitations**: What this analysis can and cannot tell us\n7. **Next Steps**: How this analysis informs further research\n\nFormat this as a professional research document (Word format) that\ncould be part of a thesis or research report.\nThe result: A complete research memo documenting your process and findings.\n\n\n18.4.2.4 Step 4: Create Presentation\nFor sharing findings:\nBased on the thematic analysis above, create a PowerPoint presentation\n(10-12 slides) suitable for [research seminar/conference/thesis committee]\nthat presents:\n\n1. Research question and context\n2. Methods (data collection, analysis approach)\n3. Themes (one theme per slide with key quotes)\n4. Interpretation and significance\n5. Limitations and future research directions\n\nInclude speaker notes with detailed explanations for each theme.\n\n\n\n18.4.3 Why This Matters (Pedagogically)\nFor research students, this teaches: - How AI accelerates qualitative research without replacing judgment - The importance of maintaining rigor (you review themes, select quotes, interpret meaning) - Documentation of research process (AI helps create the paper trail) - Distinction between AI-assisted analysis and AI-generated conclusions - Professional research communication\nCritical teaching point: “AI helps us with the time-intensive parts,transcription, initial theme identification, organization. But YOU are the researcher. You review the themes AI identified, decide if they’re accurate, select the quotes that matter, and interpret what they mean. The AI is your research assistant, not your research.”\n\n\n18.4.4 Discipline-Specific Examples\n\nHuman ResourcesBusiness & MarketingManagement & Organisational StudiesSupply Chain & LogisticsInformation SystemsTourism & HospitalityEconomicsAccounting & Finance\n\n\nI have transcripts from interviews with 8 employees exploring their\nexperience during organisational change. Conduct thematic analysis\nidentifying: how employees experienced the change, barriers they\nfaced, what supported them. Create a research memo analysing these\nthemes and their implications for change management.\n\n\nI have focus group transcripts (3 groups, 24 participants) discussing\ntheir responses to a new product concept. Conduct thematic analysis\nidentifying: what appeals to customers, concerns, willingness to\npurchase, feature priorities. Document findings in a research report.\n\n\nI have interview data (15 interviews with middle managers) exploring\nhow organisational structure affects their effectiveness. Conduct\nthematic analysis identifying structural barriers and facilitators.\nDocument in a research memo.\n\n\nI have interviews (12 suppliers) about challenges in your supply\nchain partnership. Conduct thematic analysis identifying: pain\npoints, requests for support, relationship factors.

Edit Iteratively\nAI-generated documents are starting points: - Download the document - Edit for accuracy, clarity, context - Add your specific insights or corrections - Make it yours\nThis teaches a crucial skill: AI as tool, not replacement.\n\n\n18.8.4 4. Be Transparent\nIn academic and professional contexts, disclose AI use: - “This PowerPoint was created with AI’s help” (not problematic) - “I used AI to format the presentation” (helpful tool use) - “AI generated this analysis without my review” (problematic)\nContext matters.

I have a general understanding of [what they know]\nbut need to understand the current state of research.\n\nHelp me identify:\n1. The major theoretical frameworks used in this area\n2. Key debates or controversies\n3. Seminal authors or papers I should definitely read\n4. Related concepts or search terms I should be aware of\n5. Potential gaps this research area hasn't yet addressed\n\nDo not write a literature review for me—just give me a map of the\nlandscape so I can read the original sources myself.\nWhat the student gets: A starting point, not a finished product. They still must read the actual sources.\nWhy this is acceptable: It’s like asking a senior researcher “Where should I start?” The student still does the intellectual work.\n\nUse Case 2: Source Summarization for Initial Screening\nWhen students have 50 potentially relevant articles and need to decide which ones are actually worth deep reading:\nPROMPT: Initial Screening\n\nI'm researching [specific research question]. I've identified this article:\n\n[paste article abstract and key findings]\n\nBased on this information:\n1. Is this article directly relevant to my research question?\n2. What is this article's main contribution?\n3. What theoretical framework does it use?\n4. What are its limitations relevant to my focus?\n\nI will read the full article if it's relevant—this is just helping me\nprioritize my reading list.\nWhat the student gets: Efficient triaging. They still read the relevant sources fully.\nWhy this is acceptable: This is no different from reading abstracts first. The student is still making the judgment call about relevance.\n\n\n\n19.3.3 How AI Can Be Misused\nProblematic Use 1: “Write my literature review”\nBAD PROMPT: Write a 3000-word literature review on employee engagement\nin remote work.\nWhy it’s problematic: - Student hasn’t engaged with the literature - AI will fabricate citations (hallucinate sources that don’t exist) - Student can’t defend or explain the review - No original synthesis or critical analysis\nHow to prevent: - Require annotated bibliographies (forces engagement with sources) - Require citation of specific page numbers and quotes - Assess through oral examination or viva voce - Ask students to explain contradictions or debates in their literature\n\nProblematic Use 2: Trusting AI’s theoretical analysis\nAI can describe theories but often misapplies them or oversimplifies.\nExample: AI might say “This study uses Social Exchange Theory” but miss that the study actually critiques or extends that theory in important ways.\nHow to prevent: - Teach students to verify AI’s theoretical claims against original sources - Require students to identify where AI got theory wrong - Assess theoretical sophistication through application, not just description\n\n\n\n19.3.4 Teaching Students Appropriate Literature Review with AI\nAssignment: Annotated Bibliography with AI Audit\nStudent Process: 1. Use AI to identify 30 potentially relevant sources 2. Read abstracts and select 15 most relevant 3. Read all 15 sources fully 4. Write annotated bibliography (150 words per source): - Summary of contribution - Theoretical framework used - Methodology - Relevance to research question - Critical evaluation (strengths/limitations) 5. AI Audit Section: - Ask AI to summarize 3 of the same sources - Compare AI’s summary to your own - Write 300 words: What did AI get right? What did it miss? What did it oversimplify?\nWhat this teaches: - Efficient source discovery (AI strength) - Critical reading and evaluation (human strength) - Awareness of AI’s limitations in scholarly work",

Is this method appropriate for answering this question? Why or why not?\n2. What challenges might I face with this approach?\n3. What alternative methods could I consider?\n4. What would I need to establish to make this feasible (access, ethics,\n   timeframe)?\n\nChallenge my assumptions—don't just agree with me.\nWhat the student gets: Critical feedback on methodology before they commit to an unworkable approach.\nWhy this is acceptable: Students still make the final decision. AI is playing devil’s advocate.\n\n\n\n19.4.3 How AI Can Be Misused\nProblematic: “Generate research questions for me”\nIf students simply ask AI to generate questions and choose one without deep engagement, they won’t understand: - Why the question matters - What literature it’s building on - What the theoretical contribution would be\nHow to prevent: - Require students to justify why their question is significant - Ask: “What makes this question worth answering?” - Require students to map their question to gaps in existing literature",

Below is one interview transcript.\n\nMy research question is: [specific question]\n\nSuggest potential codes or themes you see emerging in this transcript.\nThis is preliminary—I will do my own coding, but I want a starting point\nto see if I'm missing anything obvious.\n\n[paste transcript]\nWhat the student gets: Initial pattern recognition to compare against their own coding.\nWhy this is acceptable: The student still does the analytical work,deciding which codes are valid, refining them, applying them systematically across all data, and interpreting what they mean.\nCritical requirement: Student must code independently FIRST, then compare to AI suggestions.\n\nUse Case 3: Checking for Bias in Interpretation\nPROMPT: Alternative Interpretations\n\nI've identified this theme in my interview data: [theme description with\nsupporting quotes].\n\nMy interpretation is: [student's interpretation]\n\nChallenge my interpretation:\n1. What alternative ways could this data be interpreted?\n2. What am I potentially overlooking or overemphasizing?\n3. What assumptions might be driving my interpretation?\n\nHelp me ensure I'm not just seeing what I want to see in the data.\nWhat the student gets: Check against confirmation bias.\nWhy this is acceptable: Good qualitative research includes reflexivity,questioning your own interpretations. This is like peer review or supervision feedback.\n\n\n\n19.5.3 How AI Can Be Misused\nProblematic: Outsourcing analysis entirely\nIf AI does all the coding and theme identification, the student hasn’t engaged with the data. They can’t defend their findings or answer questions about them.\nHow to prevent: - Require detailed coding tables showing student’s own codes - Require justification for theme selection (why this theme and not others?) - Assess through viva voce where student must explain analytic choices - Ask students to identify quotes/examples supporting each theme (demonstrates familiarity with data)",

Verify each one.”\nThis teaches verification as a habit.\n\n\n\n19.8.3 Principle 3: Use AI to Challenge Your Thinking\nThe best research use of AI is as a critical friend: - “What assumptions am I making?” - “What have I overlooked?” - “How else could this be interpreted?” - “What are weaknesses in my argument?”\nTrain students to prompt AI to disagree with them, not just confirm their thinking.",

    "section": "19.15 Office Document Outputs: From Analysis to Professional Presentation",
    "text": "19.15 Office Document Outputs: From Analysis to Professional Presentation\n\n19.15.1 Converting Research Findings into Professional Deliverables\nBeyond the research analysis itself, postgraduate students must communicate their findings professionally. This is where document generation becomes valuable: taking research analysis and converting it into formatted, professional deliverables ready for thesis submission, conference presentation, or stakeholder communication.\n\n\n19.15.2 Three Common Scenarios\n\n19.15.2.1 Scenario 1: Research Findings → Word Document Report\nAfter qualitative analysis (like the thematic analysis workflow in Chapter 14), students can generate a professional research report:\nBased on the thematic analysis above, create a Word document research\nreport (3000-4000 words) that includes:\n\n1. **Executive Summary** (200-300 words) - What this research found and why it matters\n2. **Introduction & Context** - The research question and why it matters\n3. **Methodology** (500 words) - How data was collected and analysed\n4. **Findings** (1500-2000 words) - Themes with supporting quotes\n5. **Discussion** (800-1000 words) - What findings mean for the research area\n6. **Limitations** (300 words) - What this analysis can and cannot tell us\n7. **References** - All sources cited\n\nFormat as a professional research document with:\n- Proper heading hierarchy\n- Numbered sections\n- Professional spacing and margins\n- Ready for thesis chapter or journal submission\nTeaching point: The document format forces organisational clarity. Students can’t hide weak analysis under poor presentation. Professional formatting reveals whether thinking is rigorous.\n\n\n19.15.2.2 Scenario 2: Data Analysis → PowerPoint Presentation\nFor research students presenting findings (thesis defense, research seminar, conference):\nI've completed analysis of [research data: survey results, statistical\nanalysis, case study findings]. Create a PowerPoint presentation (15-20\nslides) suitable for [context: thesis defense / research seminar /\nconference presentation] that includes:\n\n1. Title slide with research question\n2. Context & literature (why this research matters)\n3. Methodology (how the research was conducted)\n4. Key findings (one major finding per slide, with supporting evidence)\n5. Visual representations (charts, tables, diagrams)\n6. Discussion of implications\n7. Limitations and future research\n8. Conclusion and recommendations\n\nInclude:\n- Speaker notes with detailed explanations\n- Data visualizations where appropriate\n- Professional academic design\n- Clear takeaways for each slide\nTeaching point: Research isn’t complete until it’s communicated. This scenario teaches that analysis and presentation are interconnected. Weak presentation reveals weak analysis.\n\n\n19.15.2.3 Scenario 3: Multiple Data Sources → Integrated Report\nFor mixed-method research combining qualitative and quantitative data:\nI've completed both quantitative analysis (survey data, N=200) and\nqualitative analysis (interviews, N=15). Create an integrated research\nreport (4000-5000 words) that:\n\n1. Presents quantitative findings with supporting charts/tables\n2. Presents qualitative themes with supporting quotes\n3. Triangulates findings - where do quantitative and qualitative\n   results agree/disagree?\n4. Synthesizes findings into coherent narrative\n5. Discusses implications for theory and practice\n\nFormat as a professional research document ready for thesis chapter\nsubmission, with proper citations and appendices.\nTeaching point: Mixed-method research requires integration, not just reporting both streams separately. Document generation forces students to think about how quantitative and qualitative findings relate.\n\n\n\n19.15.3 Integration with Chapter 14: “From Conversation to Document”\nThe new Chapter 14 covers office document generation in depth, including the data analysis → PowerPoint workflow demonstrated above. Research students should reference that chapter for:\n\nStep-by-step guidance on creating presentations from analysis\nDiscipline-specific examples showing how research findings are presented across business fields\nTool-specific approaches (ChatGPT artifacts, Claude canvas, Google Docs integration)\nQuality control principles for reviewing AI-generated documents\n\nKey difference: Research context requires higher standards for accuracy and rigor. When converting research findings to documents:\n\nVerify every claim - Research documents require accuracy above typical business documents\nReview quotes and citations - Ensure quotes are accurately extracted from source material\nCheck calculations - Especially for statistical findings, verify numbers are correct\nMaintain methodological rigor - Ensure research limitations and caveats are clearly stated\nPreserve academic tone - Research documents maintain formal academic voice\n\n\n\n19.15.4 Assessment Considerations\nWhen students use document generation for research deliverables:\nWhat to assess: - Is the analysis accurately represented? - Are limitations clearly acknowledged? - Is the presentation organised logically? - Are sources properly cited? - Does the document reflect genuine research understanding?\nWhat NOT to assess: - Whether the document looks professional (that’s what AI helps with) - Formatting perfection (the tool handles that) - Time spent on presentation (students can focus on analysis)\nGrading approach:\nResearch Analysis (70%):\n- Quality of research thinking\n- Rigor of methodology\n- Depth of analysis\n- Critical engagement with findings\n\nResearch Communication (30%):\n- Clarity of presentation (how well findings are explained)\n- Organisation (logical flow, clear structure)\n- Professional appearance (formatting quality)\n- Citation accuracy\n\nNote: AI assists with communication, not analysis. Grades reflect\nresearch quality, which is the actual learning objective.\n\n\n19.15.5 Boundary: When NOT to Generate Research Documents\nAvoid generating: - Literature reviews (requires deep engagement with sources) - Research proposals (requires original thinking about what to study) - Theoretical frameworks (requires original conceptualization) - Conclusions that weren’t genuinely discovered in the data - Interpretations that the student doesn’t genuinely understand\nThe principle: AI generates the presentation of research, not the research itself. If AI is doing the research thinking, you have a problem.",

    "text": "20.2 Part 1: AI Agents Explained (The Simple Version)\n\n20.2.1 What Is an Agent?\nAn agent is AI that’s been given a specific job to do, running somewhat independently toward that goal.\nHelpful Mental Model:\nThink of stages: 1. You give instructions → AI does exactly what you ask (current) 2. You set up a job → AI completes the job with minimal oversight (agents) 3. You define a goal → AI figures out the steps needed (future, very advanced)\nReal Example: Quiz Generation Agent\nWITHOUT AGENT (current approach):\n1. You write: \"Create a quiz from this material\"\n2. AI generates quiz\n3. You copy/paste into LMS\n4. Student takes quiz\n5. You manually review results\n\nWITH AGENT (what we're exploring):\n1. You set up: \"Whenever I upload course content, auto-generate a\n   difficulty-calibrated quiz and email it to students\"\n2. Agent handles: uploading, generating, checking quality, distributing\n3. You review only when: quality seems off or students struggle\n4. Agent tracks: student performance and difficulty adjustments\nThe Key Difference: With an agent, the AI does the entire workflow, not just one step.\n\n\n20.2.2 Why Agents Matter for Teaching\nTime leverage: What takes 30 minutes manually, an agent does in seconds,every single time.\nConsistency: Agents don’t get tired or inconsistent. The same process runs the same way each time.\nScaling: One agent can handle hundreds of students where manual approach maxes out at dozens.\nData insights: Agents can track patterns you’d never notice manually.",

    "text": "20.3 Part 1.5: Prompt Chaining - Simulating Agents Today (Without Needing Agent Technology)\nBefore we talk about building or using actual agents, here’s something important: you can simulate agent-like behaviour right now using prompt chaining.\nPrompt chaining is when you guide the AI through a multi-step workflow in a single conversation. The educator is the orchestrator,you direct the steps, AI executes each one, and the results build on each other.\n\n20.3.1 Why Prompt Chaining Matters\nAgents are powerful but require technical setup. Prompt chaining requires nothing but a conversation with your AI tool.\nWith prompt chaining, you can: - Break complex tasks into steps - Have the AI complete each step (you see the intermediate results) - Refine based on what you see - Redirect if something isn’t working - Combine outputs into final products\nThe educator remains in control throughout. You’re not just telling the AI “do this whole thing”,you’re directing a step-by-step process.\n\n\n20.3.2 Three Prompt Chaining Approaches\n\n20.3.2.1 Approach 1: Full Chain in One Prompt (Guided Workflow)\nGive the AI all steps at once and ask it to work through them:\nYou are an AI assistant helping create course materials.\n\nFollow these steps in order:\n1. Summarise the key concepts from [topic]\n2. Identify the three most important ideas students should understand\n3. Create a 5-question quiz testing each idea\n4. Write brief explanations for why each quiz question matters\n\nUse clear language suitable for [your discipline] students.\n\nHere is the material:\n[Paste content]\n\nBegin with Step 1 and work through all four steps.\nWhen to use: You want a complete workflow and are happy to take the output as-is with minimal adjustment.\nTeaching example:\nYou are creating a unit assessment strategy.\n\nFollow these steps:\n1. Analyse this unit's learning outcomes\n2. Identify which outcomes need formative feedback (during learning)\n3. Identify which outcomes need summative assessment (final grading)\n4. Suggest one AI-powered activity for each formative outcome\n5. Suggest one authentic assessment for each summative outcome\n\nUnit outcomes: [paste your unit outline]\n\nCreate a complete assessment plan following these steps.\n\n\n20.3.2.2 Approach 2: Modular Prompt Chain (Explicit Steps with Pauses)\nWork through steps one at a time, adjusting based on each result. This is closer to how agents actually work,step by step, human in the loop.\nStep 1: \"Create a list of the top 5 risks in [supply chain scenario].\nFor each risk, explain why it matters.\"\n\n[You review the list, then:]\n\nStep 2: \"Good. Now for each risk, suggest one control measure.\nExplain how the control reduces the risk.\"\n\n[You review, then:]\n\nStep 3: \"Now create an audit plan. What would an auditor check\nto verify these controls are working?\"\n\n[And so on...]\nWhen to use: You want to see intermediate results, provide feedback, and refine based on what the AI generates. This is the conversational, iterative approach.\nTeaching example:\nSTEP 1: \"List the major ethical dilemmas in [your discipline's case].\nFor each one, explain the competing interests.\"\n\n[You read the list and see if it matches your course focus]\n\nSTEP 2: \"Good. Now explain which ethical framework\n(utilitarian, deontological, virtue ethics) each dilemma fits best.\"\n\n[You see if the framework application is correct for your students' level]\n\nSTEP 3: \"Now create a class discussion question for each dilemma\nthat pushes students to think critically.\"\n\n[You adjust for your specific student cohort]\n\n\n20.3.2.3 Approach 3: Interactive Chain (Pause Between Steps for Your Input)\nAsk the AI to pause and wait for your approval before continuing:\nYou are helping me develop a business scenario for student learning.\n\nWe'll work through this together. After each step, I'll review\nand give you feedback before you continue.\n\nStep 1: Create a [marketing/supply chain/HR] scenario with realistic complexity.\nInclude 3-4 stakeholders with conflicting interests.\n\nPlease complete Step 1 now, then wait for my feedback\nbefore moving to Step 2.\nWhen to use: You want maximum control and want to shape the outcome as it develops. Perfect for iterative teaching material design.\nTeaching example:\nWe're building a case study together. After each step,\nI'll give you feedback and direction.\n\nSTEP 1: Create a realistic [your discipline] scenario.\nInclude a problem that requires analysis (don't give the solution).\n\nShow me Step 1 and wait for my feedback before continuing.\n\n---\n\n[You review Step 1, then:]\n\n\"Good scenario. It's too technical though.\nPlease simplify the jargon for first-year students.\nNow proceed to Step 2.\"\n\nSTEP 2: [continues based on your feedback]\n\n\n\n\n20.3.3 Key Principle: You’re the Orchestrator\nThis is crucial: you’re not writing code or building technical systems. You’re having a directed conversation.\nThink of it like conducting an orchestra: - You define the movements (steps) - Musicians (AI) execute each one - You listen and adjust - The result emerges through collaboration\nWith prompt chaining, you: - Stay in complete control - Can see and adjust at each step - Don’t need technical skills - Can redirect if something isn’t working - Use your expertise to refine outputs\n\n\n20.3.4 When to Use Prompt Chaining vs. Building an Agent\nUse prompt chaining if: - You want to try a multi-step workflow without technical setup - You need human oversight and adjustment at each step - The workflow might change based on results - You’re working one-off or occasionally (not hundreds of times) - You want to stay fully in control\nConsider an agent if (Part 2): - You run the same workflow repeatedly (100+ times) - Each instance needs the same process - You don’t need intermediate adjustments - You want set-it-and-forget-it automation - You’re willing to invest time in technical setup\n\n\n20.3.5 Teaching Application Example\nHere’s how an educator might use prompt chaining for course design:\nPROMPT 1: \"I'm designing a unit on supply chain resilience.\nWhat are the 3-4 core concepts students must understand?\"\n\n[AI gives you 4 concepts]\n\nPROMPT 2: \"Good. For each concept, suggest one teaching activity.\nWhat would students actually DO to learn this?\"\n\n[AI suggests activities]\n\nPROMPT 3: \"I like activities 2 and 4 but activity 1 is too passive.\nSuggest a more active alternative for concept 1.\"\n\n[AI gives more active option]\n\nPROMPT 4: \"Perfect. Now create a 12-week unit plan.\nEach week covers one concept plus the activity. Include:\n- Weekly learning outcome\n- Teaching activity (1-2 hours)\n- Assessment\n\nShow me the full plan.\"\n\n[You get a complete unit structure you helped shape]\n\nPROMPT 5: \"Great! Now create one detailed lesson plan for Week 3.\nInclude:\n- Minute-by-minute timing\n- Student instructions\n- Prompts for discussion\"\n\n[You get detailed implementation you can use directly]\nNotice: you never wrote a prompt longer than a sentence, but you built an entire unit through conversation.",

Access Copilot in your MS products (Word, PowerPoint, etc.) 2. Look for “Agents” or “Skills” menu 3. Explore pre-built agents for your use case 4. (Advanced) Build custom agents using Power Automate + Copilot\nPractical First Step: Try using Copilot in Word to:\n\nUpload a course document\nAsk: “Create 20 quiz questions from this material, difficulty-calibrated”\nAgent processes and returns questions\n\n\n\n20.4.2 Custom GPTs (ChatGPT)\nIf you’re using ChatGPT Plus or Pro, you can create “Custom GPTs”,specialized versions of ChatGPT trained for your specific need.\nWhat you can do: 1. Upload your course materials to the Custom GPT 2. Train it on your teaching style and requirements 3. Students interact with YOUR custom tool, not generic ChatGPT\nExample Custom GPT: “HR Case Study Analyzer”\n\nTrained on your HR course materials\nUnderstands your teaching approach\nGenerates scenarios specific to your unit\nEvaluates student responses using your rubrics\nMaintains context across a conversation\n\nHow to build: 1.

Rather than catalog them (outdated quickly), here’s how to evaluate emerging tools.\nEvaluation Framework:\nAsk these questions:\n1. Does it solve a real problem for you? - Not: “This is cool” (bad reason) - Yes: “This would save me 5 hours per month” (good reason)\n2. Is it sustainable? - Is the company stable? Or a startup that might disappear? - Is there a business model (or will it vanish when funding runs out)? - Would losing this tool break your teaching?\n3. Is data safe? - Where does your data go? - Can you export it if you leave? - Does it meet institutional requirements (Curtin data governance)?\n4. Is the learning curve worth it? - Can you learn it in 1-2 hours? - Or does it require ongoing technical support? - Do students need training to use it?\n5. Does it integrate with what you already use? - Works with Blackboard? MS Teams? Canvas? - Or is it isolated from your ecosystem?\n\n\n20.9.2 Categories of Emerging Tools\nAI Coding Assistants - GitHub Copilot, Cursor, etc. - Useful if you’re building custom tools yourself - Probably not your priority if you’re not technical\nSpecialized Learning Platforms - EdTech companies adding AI - Good if they integrate with your institution - Watch: Will they be around in 3 years?\nAgent Builders - Platforms to build custom agents without coding - High potential but rapidly evolving - Try when you have a specific problem to solve\nVideo & Content Platforms - New AI video generators emerging - Quality improving rapidly - Current: Good for simple video scripts - Future: Photorealistic educational videos\n\n\n20.9.3 Strategy for Staying Current\nRather than chasing every new tool:\n\nMaster the fundamentals (Chapters 1-12)\nUse proven platforms (ChatGPT, Claude, MS Copilot, NotebookLM)\nExperiment with emerging tools on small projects\nAdopt only if it solves a real problem for you\nStay connected to teaching communities (conferences, journals, networks)",

    "text": "20.11 Part 8.5: Emerging Capabilities - The Conversation You Need to Have\nAs AI capabilities expand, you’ll encounter new tools and possibilities. Some are genuinely useful for teaching. Others raise important questions. Rather than ignore these, let’s acknowledge them and help you think critically.\n\n20.11.1 Automated Content Creation (Slides, Videos, Scripts)\nWhat’s possible: - Automatic slide generation - Upload notes, AI creates professionally formatted slides with layouts, transitions, speaker notes - Automated video creation - AI generates educational videos from scripts, with animations, voiceover, captions - Automatic script writing - AI writes entire video scripts from course outlines - Transcript generation - Lectures automatically transcribed and summarized\nCurrent state: - These tools exist and are improving rapidly - Quality ranges from “needs heavy editing” to “surprisingly good” - Often faster to generate rough version for you to refine than to build from scratch\nTeaching questions to ask: 1. Does this improve or replace my teaching? - Good use: AI generates draft slides that you customize for your voice/style - Poor use: Uploading your content and using auto-generated output without review\n\nDo students understand the content source?\n\nGood: “I used AI to draft these slides, then refined them based on my teaching experience”\nPoor: Presenting AI-generated content as your professional creation without disclosure\n\nCan you maintain quality control?\n\nAre you reviewing generated content for accuracy?\nAre you checking examples and explanations?\nWould errors be caught before students use the material?\n\n\nRecommendation: Use for drafting and scaffolding, not final content delivery. Your expertise and review remain essential.\n\n\n20.11.2 Voice Cloning & AI Avatars\nWhat’s possible: - Voice cloning - AI learns your voice from recordings and can generate new speech in your voice - AI avatars - Digital representations that move, gesture, and “speak” for you - Deepfakes (for educational purposes) - Realistic but synthetic video of yourself\nCurrent state: - Technology exists but quality varies - Voices can sound natural or robotic depending on system - Avatars range from cartoon-like to photorealistic - Tools like HeyGen, Synthesia, and others make this accessible\nCritical considerations - Cross-Reference Chapter 8 (Ethics, Data Governance & Integrity):\nAs discussed in Chapter 8, transparency is essential. With voice cloning and avatars, this becomes crucial:\n\nConsent and Control\n\nUsing your own voice: Clear consent to train AI on your voice\nDisclaimer: “This video uses AI-generated narration in my voice”\nQuestions: Who owns the voice model? What happens when you leave?\n\nStudent Understanding\n\nStudents should know they’re learning from AI-generated content\nExplain purpose: “I used AI narration to provide flexible lecture access”\nDiscuss limitations: AI narration doesn’t replace live interaction\n\nEthical Boundaries\n\nDon’t use voice cloning to impersonate yourself in misleading ways\nDon’t create AI avatars of colleagues without explicit permission\nBe cautious with deepfakes,even for educational purposes, clarity is essential\nNever use for deception (e.g., pretending to be present when you’re not)\n\nData Governance Concerns (see Chapter 8)\n\nWhere is your voice data stored?\nCan it be used to train other models?\nWhat happens if the service closes or is acquired?\nCan you delete your voice profile and ensure it’s not reused?\n\n\nHonest assessment: - Useful for: Creating accessible lecture videos, providing multiple modalities for learning - Problematic for: Replacing your actual presence/interaction, creating deceptive content - Boundary question: If you wouldn’t do it with a student present, probably don’t do it with AI avatar\nWhen voice cloning might work:\nGood: \"I recorded my voice and created AI narrations of course materials\n       so students can listen during their commute. I disclosed this clearly.\"\n\nQuestionable: \"I created an AI avatar of myself to teach a section while\n              I was away, without telling students it wasn't me.\"\n\nWrong: \"I used AI to create a deepfake of myself to trick students\n       as a class experiment.\"\n\n\n20.11.3 Automated Grading & Feedback Generation\nWhat’s possible: - AI grading assistants - Review submissions, calculate scores, flag unusual work - Automated feedback - Generate personalised comments based on rubrics - Plagiarism detection integrated with feedback - Flag concerning passages and suggest improvements - Learning analytics - AI identifies patterns in student work across cohorts\nCurrent state: - These tools are actively being deployed in universities - Quality of generated feedback varies significantly - Can save substantial time OR produce unhelpful generic feedback\nTeaching questions to ask: 1. Who makes the final grade decision? - Good: AI suggests score, you approve/adjust based on context - Poor: AI grades submitted, you just post without review\n\nIs feedback actually useful to students?\n\nGeneric feedback (“Good work!”) wastes their time\nSpecific feedback (“Your supply chain analysis missed the resilience aspect…”) helps them improve\nAI often generates decent feedback on technical aspects, struggles with nuance\n\nWhat gets flagged?\n\nLearning patterns (student A always struggles with calculations)\nUnusual submissions (sudden quality spike might indicate external help)\nCommon misconceptions (multiple students making same error)\n\n\nCross-Reference with Chapter 8 (Ethics, Data Governance & Integrity):\nAutomated grading raises some of the same concerns as data governance: - Transparency: Students should know AI is assisting with grading - Fairness: AI systems can embed bias (Chapter 8 discusses this in detail) - Accountability: Final decision and grade remain your responsibility - Data: Student work gets processed by the system,understand where data goes\nHonest assessment: - Useful for: Identifying patterns, reducing time on routine feedback, catching inconsistencies - Problematic for: Replacing human judgment on complex work, final grading decisions - Boundary: Use AI to inform your judgment, not replace it\nWhen automated grading works:\nGood: \"I use AI to analyse 80 submissions for common errors and patterns,\n       then provide targeted feedback to address misconceptions for\n       the whole class.\"\n\nGood: \"AI flags unusual submissions (sudden quality change) for my review\n       to ensure academic integrity without me reading everything first.\"\n\nQuestionable: \"AI grades the assignments, I just review overall patterns\n              but don't look at individual grades.\"\n\nWrong: \"AI assigns final grades, I post them without reviewing.\"",

    "text": "23.10 Conclusion\nAI integration in education offers tremendous potential for expanding access and personalising learning, but only if implemented with careful attention to accessibility and inclusion. The frameworks and strategies in this chapter provide a foundation for ensuring AI-enhanced teaching benefits all students.\nKey principles for inclusive AI integration: 1. Design for everyone: Consider diverse needs from the beginning 2. Provide alternatives: Ensure multiple ways to participate and demonstrate learning 3. Remove barriers: Proactively identify and eliminate accessibility obstacles 4. Support success: Provide resources and assistance for students who need additional help 5. Continuous improvement: Regularly assess and enhance accessibility and inclusion\nBy implementing these approaches, educators can create AI-enhanced learning experiences that are not only innovative and effective but also equitable and inclusive for all students.\nNext Chapter Preview: Chapter 22 explores global perspectives and cultural adaptation, providing frameworks for implementing AI-enhanced teaching across different international contexts and educational systems.",

But the real transformation happens when entire programs evolve.\n\n25.8.1 Vision for Business Education with AI Integration\nYear 1 (Undergraduate): Students develop AI literacy alongside foundational disciplinary knowledge. They learn to use AI for exploration, practice, and self-assessment. They develop critical evaluation skills specific to their field.\nYear 2-3 (Undergraduate): Students apply AI tools to complex scenarios in their discipline. They use conversation simulations and decision-making activities extensively. They demonstrate competence through process-based assessments. They critique AI outputs and improve on them.\nYear 4-5 (Undergraduate/Honours/Research Programs): Students use AI as a professional tool. They integrate AI into strategic thinking and research in their discipline. They teach others how to use AI responsibly. They understand when AI helps and when human judgment must override technology.\nProfessional Practice: Graduates enter workplaces confident with AI tools, critical of AI limitations, and committed to ethical AI use. They advocate for fairness when organisations implement AI systems in their field. They maintain human accountability for AI-assisted decisions.\nThis is the future we’re building.\nNot a future where AI replaces professionals, but where business professionals across all disciplines use AI skillfully and ethically to do their work better,to serve people, organizations, and society more effectively.",

    "text": "A.2 Meta-Framework: Using CRAFT to Customize or Create Your Own Prompts\nThe prompts in this library are ready to use. But the real power comes from customizing them using the CRAFT framework (from Chapter 2).\nIf you want to: - Adapt a prompt for your specific context - Create a variation for your discipline - Build a completely new prompt - Make a prompt work exactly the way you need\n…use CRAFT to structure your thinking:\n\nA.2.1 Quick CRAFT Reminder\nC | Context | “This is for my second-year unit on…” |\nR | Role | “You are an experienced [professional]…” |\nA | Action | “Create/Analyse/Generate…” |\nF | Format | “500 words with 4 discussion questions…” |\nT | Tone/Target | “Professional and suitable for…” |\n\n\nA.2.2 How to Use CRAFT with These Prompts\nExample 1: Customizing an Existing Prompt\nThe Case Study Generator (Section 1.1) shows an HR version. To adapt it for your discipline using CRAFT:\nORIGINAL (HR):\n\"You are an expert lecturer in Human Resource Management...\nCreate a realistic case study scenario for my [undergraduate] students\nthat focuses on [performance management]...\"\n\nYOUR VERSION (Supply Chain, using CRAFT):\nC: This is for my second-year supply chain unit where students have studied\n   risk management and vendor relationships\nR: You are an experienced supply chain manager\nA: Create a realistic case study scenario focusing on supplier disruption\nF: 400-500 words, Australian context, 3-4 discussion questions\nT: Appropriate for students new to supply chain complexity\n\nUpdated prompt:\n\"You are an experienced supply chain manager at a major Australian manufacturer.\n\nCreate a realistic case study scenario for my undergraduate students focusing on\n[supplier disruption during supply chain crisis].\n\nRequirements:\n- The scenario should be 400-500 words\n- Set in an Australian manufacturing context\n- Include enough ambiguity that students must analyse competing priorities\n  (cost vs. reliability vs. sustainability)\n- Incorporate at least two supply chain management principles:\n  [e.g., just-in-time inventory, vendor diversification, risk mitigation]\n- End with 3-4 discussion questions requiring critical thinking about\n  supply chain strategy and resilience\n\nThe case should be challenging but appropriate for students who have covered\n[list topics: e.g., demand forecasting, supplier relationship management,\nsupply chain risk assessment].\n\nBegin.\"\nNotice: The structure is identical, but every element is adapted to your discipline using CRAFT.\nExample 2: Creating a New Prompt\nYou want a prompt that doesn’t exist in this library. Use CRAFT:\nWhat I need: \"A prompt that helps students analyse a real supply chain problem\"\n\nCRAFT structure:\nC: This is for my applied supply chain unit where students work with real\n   companies on live projects\nR: You are a supply chain consultant advising on optimization\nA: Analyse this supply chain problem and recommend solutions\nF: 2000-word analysis with data tables, visualizations, and implementation plan\nT: Professional consultant-level analysis\n\nYour new prompt:\n\"You are a supply chain consultant with 15+ years of experience optimizing\nglobal supply chains.\n\nI'm working with a supply chain team on a real optimization challenge.\nThey've provided raw data on their current network.\n\nPlease provide a comprehensive analysis including:\n1. Current state assessment (cost, delivery time, resilience)\n2. Comparison of three optimization scenarios\n3. Implementation roadmap with timeline\n4. Key risks and mitigation strategies\n5. Expected outcomes and metrics\n\nFormat your analysis as a professional report suitable for executive presentation.\nUse tables and data where appropriate.\n\nHere is the supply chain data:\n[paste data]\n\nBegin.\"\nAgain, CRAFT structure ensures your prompt is complete and specific.\n\n\nA.2.3 Why This Matters\nWithout CRAFT thinking: - Your prompt might be vague - AI outputs might miss your context - You might need multiple back-and-forths to get what you want - Result: generic “AI sameness”\nWith CRAFT structure: - Your prompt is clear and specific - AI understands your exact context - Results are often usable on the first try - If you need to refine, you know exactly what element to adjust - Result: content tailored to YOUR teaching\n\n\nA.2.4 Customization Patterns\nPattern 1: Changing the Role Keep everything the same, change who the AI is:\nORIGINAL: \"You are an expert lecturer in HR...\"\nYOUR VERSION: \"You are an experienced supply chain manager...\"\nPattern 2: Changing the Audience Keep everything the same, adjust for your students:\nORIGINAL: \"...for my undergraduate students...\"\nYOUR VERSION: \"...for my postgraduate students with 5+ years experience...\"\nPattern 3: Changing the Discipline Adapt Context, Role, and Action for your field:\nORIGINAL (HR): Create a performance management scenario\nYOUR VERSION (Finance): Create an audit finding communication scenario\nPattern 4: Changing the Scope Adjust Format and Tone:\nORIGINAL: \"500 words with discussion questions\"\nYOUR VERSION: \"2000-word detailed analysis with tables and visualizations\"\n\n\nA.2.5 Pro Tip: Combine CRAFT with Follow-Up Conversations\nRemember from Chapter 2: CRAFT is a starting point, not the endpoint.\nAfter you send your CRAFT-structured prompt: 1. Review the first output 2. Follow up with refinements: “Good, but make it more [specific]” 3. Adapt based on what you see: “I like that approach, now add…” 4. Iterate until it’s exactly what you need\nThe library gives you starting points. CRAFT helps you customize them. And follow-up conversations perfect them.",

RIGOR: What would strengthen the rigor of this approach?\n4. ALTERNATIVES: What alternative or complementary methods should I\n   consider?\n5. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS: What ethical issues do I need to address?\n\nChallenge my assumptions—don't just agree with me. Help me identify\npotential problems before I commit to this approach.\n\n\n\nA.8.6 6.6 Citation Verification Reminder (Not a Prompt,A Protocol)\nBefore submitting any research work:\n\nNever trust AI-generated citations without verification\nFor every source AI mentions:\n\nSearch for it in Google Scholar, your library database, or Web of Science\nConfirm the paper exists\nConfirm the authors are correct\nConfirm the publication year and journal are correct\nActually read the paper (or at minimum the abstract)\nConfirm it says what AI claimed it says\n\nRed flags for hallucinated citations:\n\nYou can’t find the paper in any database\nThe journal name seems odd or unfamiliar\nThe authors don’t appear to have published in this area\nThe title is suspiciously perfect for your exact topic\n\nIf you can’t verify a citation, DO NOT USE IT\n\nThis is non-negotiable for academic integrity.\n\n\n\nA.8.7 How to Use These Research Prompts\nFor Students: These prompts help you work more efficiently, but they don’t replace genuine intellectual work. Use them to:\n\nExplore new areas quickly\nCheck your thinking for blind spots\nGet unstuck when you’re not sure how to proceed\nImprove your writing clarity and structure\n\nNever use them to: - Generate literature reviews you haven’t read - Create analysis of data you haven’t engaged with - Write arguments you don’t understand - Cite papers you haven’t verified exist\nFor Supervisors: Share these prompts with your research students, but emphasize:\n\nAI accelerates process, not insight\nVerification is mandatory\nYou will ask probing questions to ensure genuine understanding\nOral examinations will reveal whether students did the work",

AI just makes personalised practice feasible for all students, not just a lucky few.\n\n\n\nB.3.2 Core Concept: Zero Learning Curve (10 minutes)\nKey message: If you can use Google, you can use AI.\nWhat AI is (and isn’t): - Is: Sophisticated text pattern generator that follows instructions - Isn’t: Intelligent, creative, or reliable without human oversight - Think of it as: Tireless teaching assistant that needs your guidance\nThe skill isn’t technical—it’s pedagogical: - What do you want students to learn? - How will you assess their thinking? - What scenarios provide authentic practice?\n\n\n\nB.3.3 Live Demo: Three Quick Wins (20 minutes)\nThis is the heart of the workshop. Show, don’t just tell.\n\nB.3.3.1 Demo 1: Bad Prompt vs. Good Prompt (5 minutes)\nBad prompt (type live):\nWrite a case study about business.\nShow generic, unhelpful result.\nGood prompt (discipline-specific):\n\nHRMarketingFinanceManagement\n\n\nYou are an expert HR lecturer. Create a 400-word case study for \nundergraduate students about a workplace conflict involving alleged \ndiscrimination. Set it in an Australian context. Include 3 discussion \nquestions requiring critical analysis. Begin.\n\n\nYou are an expert Marketing lecturer. Create a 400-word case study for \nundergraduate students about a brand crisis and competitive response. \nFocus on marketing strategy and customer perception.

Create a 400-word case study for \nundergraduate students about an investment dilemma with ethical implications. \nInclude 3 discussion questions requiring critical analysis. Begin.\n\n\nYou are an expert Management lecturer. Create a 400-word case study for \nundergraduate students about an organisational change facing stakeholder \nresistance. Include 3 discussion questions requiring critical analysis. Begin.\n\n\n\nShow much better result.\nKey point: Same tool, different instruction. Quality depends entirely on what you ask for.\n\n\nB.3.3.2 Demo 2: Conversation Simulation (10 minutes)\nSetup prompt (type live):\nYou are Jamie, a team leader called to HR because a team member \ncomplained about your \"micromanagement.\"\n\nYour perspective: You believe you're doing your job properly and that \nemployee is oversensitive. You're defensive but professional.\n\nHidden context: You've been under enormous pressure to meet targets and \nhaven't had management training. You'll reveal this only if HR person \nasks good questions and shows empathy.\n\nI am the HR representative. Stay in character.\n\nI'll begin: \"Thanks for meeting with me today, Jamie. I wanted to talk \nwith you about some concerns that have been raised...\"\nHave 5-7 exchanges live. Make deliberate mistakes to show it’s not perfect.\nDebrief: “Imagine every student practicing this 5 times before assessment. They learn from mistakes without requiring 60 individual role-plays or inconsistent peer practice.”\n\n\nB.3.3.3 Demo 3: Instant Feedback Tool (5 minutes)\nShow a mediocre student response (prepare 2-3 paragraphs with flaws).\nFeedback prompt (type live):\nYou are a [DISCIPLINE] lecturer. Evaluate this student's response. \nTell them what they did well and what needs improvement. Focus on:\n1. Issue identification\n2. Theory application  \n3. Practical recommendations\n\n[paste student response here]\nKey message: Students get immediate formative feedback. You still grade final work, but it’s much better quality.\n\n\n\n\nB.3.4 Hands-On Practice (15 minutes)\nYour instruction: “Your turn. Write one prompt for something you actually teach.”\nThree options: 1. Generate teaching content (case study, scenario, discussion questions) 2. Create role-play persona (for student practice) 3. Design feedback tool (for student work improvement)\nQuick Start Template (handout):\nYou are [your role: expert lecturer in YOUR DISCIPLINE].\n\nI need you to [specific task] for my [audience: student level].\n\nRequirements:\n- [Requirement 1: length, format]\n- [Requirement 2: discipline-specific focus]\n- [Requirement 3: learning outcome]\n\nBegin.\nCirculate and help. After 10 minutes, test 2-3 prompts live (or have volunteers test if they have devices).\n\n\n\nB.3.5 Addressing Concerns & Next Steps (10 minutes)\nCommon concerns and responses:\nQ: “What about academic integrity?” A: “Chapter 9 covers this in depth. Short answer: Make AI use transparent, then grade students’ critical evaluation of AI outputs, not their avoidance of it.”\nQ: “I’m not technical.” A: “If you can use Google, you can use AI. The challenge is pedagogical, not technical: What do you want students to learn? How will you assess it?”\nQ: “What if AI gives wrong information?” A: “Perfect! That’s a teaching opportunity. When students catch AI errors, they’re developing exactly the critical thinking we want.”\nNext steps for participants: 1. This week: Create one prompt for something you’re teaching next month 2. This month: Try one low-stakes AI activity with students\n3. This semester: Pilot one AI-enhanced assignment (10-15% of grade)\nYour support: - Share this book link - Offer individual help - Create faculty learning community",

The specific platform matters less than the pedagogical approach.”\n\n\nB.7.2 Fear: “AI will make students lazy”\nResponse: “Actually, it makes them think harder. When students must critique AI outputs, identify errors, and improve on them, they’re doing higher-order thinking, not avoiding work.”\n\n\nB.7.3 Overwhelm: “I don’t have time to learn this”\nResponse: “Start with one prompt. That’s it. Try it yourself. If it works, expand. If not, try something else. Small experiments, not curriculum overhaul.”\n\n\nB.7.4 Technical Anxiety: “I’m not good with technology”\nResponse: “You don’t need to be. If you can type an email, you can use AI. The challenge isn’t technical—it’s knowing what to ask for. That’s your teaching expertise.”\n\n\nB.7.5 Quality Concerns: “What if AI gives wrong information?”\nResponse: “Perfect teaching opportunity.

It’s about using available tools to better achieve existing learning outcomes,to prepare confident, competent, ethical professionals across all business disciplines who can navigate the complexity of modern workplaces and organizations.\nEvery application in this book has been designed to support documented Curtin learning outcomes. AI enhances pedagogical practice; it doesn’t replace educational judgment or lower academic standards.\nThis book provides Curtin business lecturers with: - Institutional justification (alignment with strategy and learning outcomes across all disciplines) - Pedagogical frameworks (grounded in learning theory and discipline-specific practice) - Practical tools (ready-to-use prompts and assignments adaptable to your discipline) - Implementation guidance (start small, scale gradually) - Academic integrity approaches (transparency and critical engagement)\nThe question is not whether AI belongs in business education at Curtin.\nGiven the university’s strategic commitment to AI and the professional reality that graduates will work in AI-augmented workplaces regardless of their discipline, the question is how to integrate AI responsibly and effectively into your teaching.\nThis book provides the answer,for HR education, marketing, accounting, management, tourism & hospitality, supply chain, information systems, economics, and beyond.",

    "section": "D.11 Context Management for Advanced Prompting",
    "text": "D.11 Context Management for Advanced Prompting\n\nD.11.1 Why Context Management Matters for Advanced Prompts\nAs your prompting becomes more sophisticated,combining multiple techniques, working through longer sequences, managing complex educational scenarios,the quality of context management becomes critical.\nAdvanced prompts demand focused conversations: - Sophisticated personas require consistent framing across exchanges - Complex discipline-specific scenarios need clear boundaries - Multi-step educational sequences benefit from structured progression - Quality control over professional materials demands careful output management\n\n\nD.11.2 Key Strategies for Advanced Prompts\n1. Structure Complex Tasks as Multi-Step Sequences\nInstead of asking for everything at once, break advanced prompts into focused steps:\nPROMPT 1: \"Help me structure a capstone project on [topic]\"\n[Get: high-level plan]\n\nPROMPT 2: \"Using that structure, define learning outcomes\"\n[Get: aligned outcomes]\n\nPROMPT 3: \"Now design the assessment rubric\"\n[Get: quality rubric focused on outcomes]\n\nPROMPT 4: \"Create student instructions based on the rubric\"\n[Get: clear, actionable instructions]\nEach prompt gets full attention. Quality increases because output tokens aren’t split among competing demands.\n2. Maintain Context Across Conversations\nWhen you need to continue advanced work in a new conversation:\nI'm continuing work on [project name]. Here's what we've already designed:\n- [Element 1]: [brief description]\n- [Element 2]: [brief description]\n\nHere's what we've decided about [important constraint]:\n[key decision or principle]\n\nNow let's design [next element]. Keep consistency with [previous element].\nThis prevents hallucination and maintains continuity in sophisticated work.\n3. Use Output Constraints Strategically\nFor advanced prompts requesting multiple components, specify allocation:\nI need a complete course design including three components:\n\n1. Learning outcomes (150–200 words total) - prioritize clarity and measurability\n2. Assessment strategy (200–250 words) - must align with outcomes\n3. Facilitator notes (250–300 words) - include teaching tips and common student challenges\n\nKeep total output around 600–750 words. Prioritize depth of thought over comprehensive coverage.\nThis prevents shallow outputs and ensures each component receives adequate focus.\n4. Archive and Reference Advanced Work\nFor complex materials that take multiple conversations to develop:\nI've developed course materials across 3 conversations. Here's the complete\nresource library I've built:\n\n**Session 1 outputs:**\n- Course outline (created [date])\n- Learning outcomes framework (created [date])\n\n**Session 2 outputs:**\n- Assessment rubric (created [date])\n- Unit 1 detailed design (created [date])\n\nI'm continuing with Unit 2. Keep consistency with the patterns established\nin Unit 1. Here's Unit 1 for reference: [paste]\n\nNow design Unit 2 following the same structure and pedagogical approach.\nThis maintains coherence across extended development work.\n\n\nD.11.3 For Advanced Teaching Sequences\nWhen designing complex learning sequences (like the prompt chaining in Chapter 8 or multi-week simulations), context management keeps quality consistent:\nBreak it into phases: 1. Phase 1 (Conversation 1): Design the learning arc and sequence 2. Phase 2 (Conversation 2): Develop Phase 1 components in detail 3. Phase 3 (Conversation 3): Develop Phase 2 components, referring back to Phase 1 4. Integration (Conversation 4): Ensure all phases connect coherently\nThis modular approach produces more coherent educational experiences than trying to design everything at once.\n\n\nD.11.4 Cross-Reference\nFor comprehensive context management strategies, see Chapter 6: Managing LLM Context. That chapter covers: - Breaking complex tasks into focused steps - Managing conversation length effectively - Explicit context specification - Batching similar tasks - Summarizing and handing off for extended projects",

Pros and Cons\n\nE.4.1 C.R.E.A.T.E.\n\nVerdict: Best for users who prefer to guide the AI through demonstration and fix errors as they go.\n\n\nPros:\n\nIterative Refinement: The “Adjustment” phase institutionalizes the idea that prompting is a process, not a one-off command.\nHigher Accuracy via Examples: AI models generally perform significantly better with “few-shot” prompting (providing examples).\nStrong Persona: Anchors the AI in a specific role immediately.\n\nCons:\n\nTone Blind spots: Doesn’t explicitly ask for the Target Audience.\nTime Consuming: The structure assumes a multi-step interaction.\n\n\n\n\nE.4.2 C.R.A.F.T.\n\nVerdict: Best for professionals who need a specific voice/style and want a “one-and-done” result.\n\n\nPros:\n\nContext King: By starting with Context, it reduces “hallucinations” by bounding the AI’s knowledge scope.\nAudience Alignment: Explicitly defining the “Target” ensures the language complexity is appropriate (e.g., Novice vs. Expert).\nAction Oriented: Separating “Role” and “Action” provides high clarity on the deliverable.\n\nCons:\n\nNo Examples: It relies on describing what you want rather than showing it. Describing a complex format is often harder than providing a sample.\nRigid: Less focus on post-generation refinement.",

You provide a snippet (Example) and ask the AI to replicate the style. * Data Formatting: You have messy text and need it cleaned into a specific JSON structure. You provide an Example of the schema. * Learning/Exploration: You aren’t 100% sure what you want yet, so you use the Adjustment phase to explore ideas and refine results.\nWhen to use C.R.A.F.T.: * Internal Communications: Writing a memo to staff. You need to set the Context (why the change is happening) and the Target (staff members). * Content Marketing: Writing a blog post. You need to specify the Tone (witty, professional) and the Context (product details). * Summarization: You paste a long report and need a summary. You define the Context (what the report is about) and the Format (bullet points).",
