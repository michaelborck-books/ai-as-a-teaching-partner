# Workshop Guide: Training Your Colleagues

## Purpose: Train the Trainer

This appendix equips you to run AI integration workshops for your colleagues. Whether you're presenting at a faculty meeting, leading a professional development session, or training your teaching team, this provides the framework, examples, and confidence-building activities you need.

**Why run workshops?** You become a force multiplier—extending the book's impact beyond your own classroom and building institutional capacity for AI-enhanced teaching.

**The Hook: What if you could help 20 colleagues transform their teaching in one hour?**

This guide gives you everything needed to run effective workshops that scale AI integration across your department. You don't need to be the AI expert—you need to be the teaching expert who can open doors for colleagues.

## Workshop Overview

**Title:** "AI as a Teaching Partner: Practical Applications for Business Education"  
**Duration:** 60 minutes  
**Audience:** Business faculty (all disciplines) with varying technical confidence  
**Goal:** Participants leave with one concrete idea they can implement next week

**Key Philosophy:** Make it accessible, practical, and focused on teaching—not technology.

---

## Workshop Structure (60 minutes)

### Opening: The Possibility (5 minutes)

**Your opening question:**
> "What if every student could practice professional scenarios 10 times before facing real assessment?"

**Core message:** AI isn't about replacing teaching—it's about scaling what we know works but can't do for everyone.

**Traditional vs. AI-Enhanced:**

| Traditional Approach | AI-Enhanced Approach |
|---|---|
| Case study (read once) | Conversation simulation (practice repeatedly) |
| Group discussion (limited participation) | Individual role-play (everyone practices) |
| Written assignment (delayed feedback) | Immediate AI feedback |

**Why this matters:** You're still the expert designer. AI just makes personalized practice feasible for all students, not just a lucky few.

---

### Core Concept: Zero Learning Curve (10 minutes)

**Key message:** If you can use Google, you can use AI.

**What AI is (and isn't):**
- **Is:** Sophisticated text pattern generator that follows instructions
- **Isn't:** Intelligent, creative, or reliable without human oversight
- **Think of it as:** Tireless teaching assistant that needs your guidance

**The skill isn't technical—it's pedagogical:**
- What do you want students to learn?
- How will you assess their thinking?
- What scenarios provide authentic practice?

---

### Live Demo: Three Quick Wins (20 minutes)

This is the heart of the workshop. Show, don't just tell.

#### Demo 1: Bad Prompt vs. Good Prompt (5 minutes)

**Bad prompt (type live):**
```
Write a case study about business.
```
*Show generic, unhelpful result.*

**Good prompt (discipline-specific):**

::: {.panel-tabset}

## HR
```
You are an expert HR lecturer. Create a 400-word case study for 
undergraduate students about a workplace conflict involving alleged 
discrimination. Set it in an Australian context. Include 3 discussion 
questions requiring critical analysis. Begin.
```

## Marketing
```
You are an expert Marketing lecturer. Create a 400-word case study for 
undergraduate students about a brand crisis and competitive response. 
Focus on marketing strategy and customer perception. Include 3 discussion 
questions requiring critical analysis. Begin.
```

## Finance
```
You are an expert Finance lecturer. Create a 400-word case study for 
undergraduate students about an investment dilemma with ethical implications. 
Include 3 discussion questions requiring critical analysis. Begin.
```

## Management
```
You are an expert Management lecturer. Create a 400-word case study for 
undergraduate students about an organisational change facing stakeholder 
resistance. Include 3 discussion questions requiring critical analysis. Begin.
```

:::

*Show much better result.*

**Key point:** Same tool, different instruction. Quality depends entirely on what you ask for.

#### Demo 2: Conversation Simulation (10 minutes)

**Setup prompt (type live):**
```
You are Jamie, a team leader called to HR because a team member 
complained about your "micromanagement."

Your perspective: You believe you're doing your job properly and that 
employee is oversensitive. You're defensive but professional.

Hidden context: You've been under enormous pressure to meet targets and 
haven't had management training. You'll reveal this only if HR person 
asks good questions and shows empathy.

I am the HR representative. Stay in character.

I'll begin: "Thanks for meeting with me today, Jamie. I wanted to talk 
with you about some concerns that have been raised..."
```

**Have 5-7 exchanges live.** Make deliberate mistakes to show it's not perfect.

**Debrief:** "Imagine every student practicing this 5 times before assessment. They learn from mistakes without requiring 60 individual role-plays or inconsistent peer practice."

#### Demo 3: Instant Feedback Tool (5 minutes)

**Show a mediocre student response** (prepare 2-3 paragraphs with flaws).

**Feedback prompt (type live):**
```
You are a [DISCIPLINE] lecturer. Evaluate this student's response. 
Tell them what they did well and what needs improvement. Focus on:
1. Issue identification
2. Theory application  
3. Practical recommendations

[paste student response here]
```

**Key message:** Students get immediate formative feedback. You still grade final work, but it's much better quality.

---

### Hands-On Practice (15 minutes)

**Your instruction:** "Your turn. Write one prompt for something you actually teach."

**Three options:**
1. **Generate teaching content** (case study, scenario, discussion questions)
2. **Create role-play persona** (for student practice)
3. **Design feedback tool** (for student work improvement)

**Quick Start Template (handout):**
```
You are [your role: expert lecturer in YOUR DISCIPLINE].

I need you to [specific task] for my [audience: student level].

Requirements:
- [Requirement 1: length, format]
- [Requirement 2: discipline-specific focus]
- [Requirement 3: learning outcome]

Begin.
```

**Circulate and help.** After 10 minutes, test 2-3 prompts live (or have volunteers test if they have devices).

---

### Addressing Concerns & Next Steps (10 minutes)

**Common concerns and responses:**

**Q: "What about academic integrity?"**
A: "Chapter 9 covers this in depth. Short answer: Make AI use transparent, then grade students' critical evaluation of AI outputs, not their avoidance of it."

**Q: "I'm not technical."**
A: "If you can use Google, you can use AI. The challenge is pedagogical, not technical: What do you want students to learn? How will you assess it?"

**Q: "What if AI gives wrong information?"**
A: "Perfect! That's a teaching opportunity. When students catch AI errors, they're developing exactly the critical thinking we want."

**Next steps for participants:**
1. **This week:** Create one prompt for something you're teaching next month
2. **This month:** Try one low-stakes AI activity with students  
3. **This semester:** Pilot one AI-enhanced assignment (10-15% of grade)

## Building Critical Thinking with AI

### Beyond Basic Prompts

**1. AI as Debate Partner**
```
Present this business policy: "[relevant policy]"

You argue FOR this policy. I will argue AGAINST it.
After 3 rounds, summarize strongest arguments from both sides.
Then ask me to identify which arguments are most persuasive and why.
```

**2. Multiple Perspective Analysis**
```
Analyze this business decision from 4 perspectives:
1. Financial impact
2. Ethical considerations  
3. Stakeholder effects
4. Long-term consequences

Then ask students to evaluate which perspective carries most weight.
```

**3. Pros/Cons Evaluation**
```
Evaluate this business strategy: "[strategy]"

Provide:
- 5 potential benefits
- 5 potential risks
- 3 mitigation strategies
- Final recommendation with reasoning

Then ask students to critique your analysis.
```

**Why this works:** Students learn to evaluate multiple viewpoints, identify bias, construct arguments, and make evidence-based decisions.

---

## Assessment Design Shift

### From Product to Process

**Traditional Assessment:** Submit final business plan  
**Process Assessment:** Show AI conversation + reflection + improvement

**Example workflow:**
1. **AI Practice:** Handle scenario (recorded)
2. **Self-Analysis:** Student identifies what worked/didn't
3. **Improvement:** Practice again with refined approach  
4. **Reflection:** What did you learn about professional judgment?

**Benefits:**
- Assesses thinking, not just final output
- Makes learning process visible
- Develops metacognitive skills
- Reduces academic integrity concerns

---

## Handling Common Faculty Concerns

### Skepticism: "This is just a fad"
**Response:** "The tools will change, but the principle won't. Students need practice with realistic scenarios. AI makes that scalable. The specific platform matters less than the pedagogical approach."

### Fear: "AI will make students lazy"
**Response:** "Actually, it makes them think harder. When students must critique AI outputs, identify errors, and improve on them, they're doing higher-order thinking, not avoiding work."

### Overwhelm: "I don't have time to learn this"
**Response:** "Start with one prompt. That's it. Try it yourself. If it works, expand. If not, try something else. Small experiments, not curriculum overhaul."

### Technical Anxiety: "I'm not good with technology"
**Response:** "You don't need to be. If you can type an email, you can use AI. The challenge isn't technical—it's knowing what to ask for. That's your teaching expertise."

### Quality Concerns: "What if AI gives wrong information?"
**Response:** "Perfect teaching opportunity. When students catch AI errors, they're developing exactly the critical thinking and professional skepticism we want."

## Final Note

Your goal isn't to convert everyone to AI use. Your goal is to:

1. **Demystify** - Show AI is accessible, not scary
2. **Spark curiosity** - Demonstrate what's possible  
3. **Provide pathway** - Give tools and support
4. **Build confidence** - Help colleagues take first steps

Some will implement immediately. Some will wait and watch. Some will remain skeptical. All are fine.

**Success is planting seeds and offering support.** The faculty ready to grow will flourish from there.
