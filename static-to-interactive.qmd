  - Assistant flags 3 urgent issues
  - Student chooses which to address first

SCENE 2: First situation unfolds
  - Student makes decision
  - Consequences play out
  - New complications arise

SCENE 3-4: Additional layers of complexity
  - Stakeholder reactions
  - Policy constraints
  - Budget limitations
```

**Prompt for generating this:**
```
Create a complex HR scenario game where students make sequential decisions
with cascading consequences:

Setup: [Describe initial situation]

Required elements:
1. 5-6 decision points
2. Multiple stakeholder perspectives shown
3. Consequences that compound (early decisions affect later options)
4. Ethical dilemmas with no perfect answer
5. Complete playthrough takes 20-30 minutes

Format: HTML game with narrative text, decision buttons, and outcome tracking.
```

### Infographics & Visual Storytelling

**Transforming data into narrative:**

```
Before: "The supply chain disruption affected lead times by 45% in Q2"
After: Visual timeline showing impact progression with icons, key events,
       stakeholder reactions, and resolution
```

**Prompt Template:**
```
Create an interactive infographic showing [business scenario]:

## Exporting Conversation Results: From Interactive Back to Document

### When Students Generate Deliverables

A complementary workflow to this chapter's focus on transforming static content to interactive experiences is students using AI to **generate professional documents from their conversations and analyses**.

When students:
- Complete an interactive simulation and want to document their decisions
- Have a conversation analyzing a case study and need to produce a report
- Gather data and want to create a presentation of findings
- Conduct analysis and need professional documentation

...they can request AI generate the appropriate document format.

### Common Scenarios

#### **Interactive Simulation → Report**

A student completes an interactive business scenario (built using the techniques in this chapter), then wants to document their learning:

```
I just completed an interactive business simulation where I made strategic
decisions about [topic]. The simulation walked me through [scenario].

Here's what I decided and why:
[Student describes their choices and reasoning]

Create a professional business report (1500-2000 words) documenting:
1. The scenario and decision context
2. The strategic choices I made
3. My reasoning for each decision
4. How those choices affected outcomes
5. What I learned from the simulation

Format as a professional report suitable for [class submission/portfolio].
```

#### **Conversation Analysis → Presentation**

A student has an extended conversation with AI analyzing a complex business case, then needs to present findings:

```
I've had a detailed conversation analyzing [case study]. Here's a summary
of what we explored:
[Paste key points from conversation]

Create a PowerPoint presentation (12-15 slides) that presents these findings
in a way suitable for [class presentation / stakeholder meeting / board review].

Include:
- Executive summary of the case
- Key analysis points
- My strategic recommendations
- Supporting evidence
- Visual representations where appropriate
```

#### **Data Exploration → Technical Report**

A student explores a dataset conversationally with AI, then needs to document findings:

```
I've explored this dataset with AI analysis, identifying [key patterns].
The main findings are:
[List findings with supporting data]

Create a professional data analysis report (2000-3000 words) that:
1. Describes the dataset and analysis approach
2. Presents findings with supporting visualizations
3. Discusses implications for [business context]
4. Recommends next steps

Format as a technical report suitable for [stakeholder type].
```

### Integration with Chapter 14: "From Conversation to Document"

The new Chapter 14 ("From Conversation to Document") covers this workflow in comprehensive detail, including:

- **Complete step-by-step guidance** on generating Word documents, PowerPoint presentations, and Excel files from AI conversations
- **Data analysis → PowerPoint workflow** - the exact workflow of CSV upload → analysis → visualizations → presentation that you may demo
- **Qualitative analysis → documentation workflow** - audio transcription → thematic analysis → research memo
- **Discipline-specific examples** across all 8 business fields
- **Tool-specific approaches** for different AI platforms and export options
- **Quality control principles** for reviewing AI-generated documents

### Teaching Application

#### **Assessment Strategy When Students Generate Documents**

When students use AI to generate presentations or reports:

**What to assess:**
- ✓ Quality of analysis/thinking behind the document
- ✓ Accuracy of data representation
- ✓ Clarity of communication
- ✓ Appropriateness of format for audience
- ✓ Evidence of student judgment and decision-making

**What NOT to assess:**
- ✗ Formatting perfection (AI handles that)
- ✗ Time spent on presentation design (focus was analysis)
- ✗ Writing quality at sentence level (AI assists with writing)

**Grading recommendation:**
```
Instead of:
"Write a 2000-word report analyzing [case study]"

Try:
"Analyze [case study] with AI's help, then request AI generate a
professional report of your analysis. Submit:
1. A summary of your analysis process (500 words)
2. The generated report
3. A reflection on what the document shows about your understanding"
```

This reveals thinking, not just output.

#### **Where This Fits in Your Teaching**

This workflow complements the static-to-interactive work in this chapter:

| Direction | Chapter Focus | Tool Purpose |
|-----------|---|---|
| **Static → Interactive** | This Chapter (13) | Engage students *in* learning |
| **Interactive/Conversation → Document** | Chapter 14 | Students *communicate* their learning |

Both represent the full cycle of AI-enhanced teaching:
1. Transform static content to interactive experience (Chapter 13)
2. Students engage with interactive content, have conversations, conduct analysis
3. Students use AI to generate professional deliverables of their work (Chapter 14)
4. Students submit documents reflecting genuine learning
