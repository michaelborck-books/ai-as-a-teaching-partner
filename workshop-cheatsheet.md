# AI in HR Education: One-Hour Faculty Workshop

**Focus: Simple prompts → powerful teaching outcomes**  
**Audience: HR lecturers (low-tech, smart, practical)**  
**Goal: Show potential without overwhelming**

,

## 🎯 Opening Hook (5 minutes)

**"What if your students could practice HR scenarios infinitely, with instant feedback?"**

- No coding required
- No software installation  
- Just plain English instructions
- Start small, scale gradually

,

## 💡 The Core Concept: Chat Interface as Teaching Tool (10 minutes)

### Traditional vs. AI-Enhanced

| Traditional Approach | AI-Enhanced Approach |
|,,,,,,-|,,,,,,,|
| Case study (read once) | Conversation simulation (practice repeatedly) |
| Group discussion (limited participation) | Individual role-play (everyone practices) |
| Written assignment (delayed feedback) | Immediate AI feedback |

### Why Chat Interface Works
- **Zero learning curve** - Everyone can use a website
- **Process over product** - Focus on thinking, not final answer
- **Engagement through interaction** - Active vs. passive learning

,

## 🚀 Live Demo: Three Quick Wins (15 minutes)

### 1. **Conversation Starter** (2 minutes)
```
You are an experienced HR manager conducting a termination meeting for poor performance. I am the employee being terminated. 

Start the conversation professionally but with empathy. Include:
- Clear explanation of the decision
- Specific performance issues that led to this outcome
- Next steps for the employee
- Support resources available

Begin the conversation now.
```

### 2. **Instant Feedback Generator** (2 minutes)  
```
Review this HR response and provide constructive feedback:

"[paste student response here]"

Evaluate and suggest improvements for:
1. **Tone and professionalism** - Is it appropriate for the situation?
2. **Legal compliance** - Any potential employment law issues?
3. **Clarity and structure** - Is the message clear and well-organized?
4. **Stakeholder impact** - How might this affect employees/organization?
5. **Alternative approaches** - What other ways could this be handled?

Provide specific, actionable suggestions for improvement.
```

### 3. **Critical Thinking Developer** (2 minutes)
```
I need you to help develop critical thinking skills in HR education.

Present this HR scenario to students:
"An employee has been consistently late for work, affecting team performance. Their manager wants to terminate them immediately."

First, ask students: "What should HR do and why?"

After they respond, provide:
1. **Multiple perspectives** - Legal, ethical, practical, cultural viewpoints
2. **Pros and cons** of different approaches (immediate termination vs. warning vs. support)
3. **Stakeholder analysis** - Impact on employee, team, manager, organisation
4. **Long-term consequences** of each option
5. **Professional standards** - What HR best practices suggest

Then ask students to evaluate your analysis and identify any missing considerations.

## 🧠 Building Critical Thinking with AI (5 minutes)

### How AI Develops Higher-Order Thinking

**Traditional Approach:** Students read one perspective
**AI-Enhanced:** Students evaluate multiple perspectives

### Critical Thinking Techniques

#### 1. **AI as Debate Partner**
```
Present this HR policy: "Remote work should be available to all employees permanently."

You argue FOR this policy. I will argue AGAINST it.
After 3 rounds of debate, summarize the strongest arguments from both sides.
Then ask me to identify which arguments are most persuasive and why.
```

#### 2. **Pros/Cons Analysis**
```
Analyse this HR decision: "Implementing AI-powered resume screening."

Provide:
- 5 potential benefits (efficiency, consistency, cost)
- 5 potential risks (bias, legal issues, dehumanization)
- 3 mitigation strategies for the risks
- Final recommendation with reasoning

Then ask students to critique your analysis.
```

#### 3. **Perspective-Taking Exercise**
```
This HR scenario: "Employee refuses COVID vaccine for medical reasons."

Analyse from 4 perspectives:
1. **Employee rights** - Legal, ethical, personal autonomy
2. **Employer obligations** - Workplace safety, business continuity  
3. **Team impact** - Colleague safety, team dynamics
4. **Societal context** - Public health, organisational responsibility

Ask students: Which perspective carries most weight and why?
```

### Why This Works

**Students learn to:**
- **Evaluate multiple viewpoints** - not just their initial reaction
- **Identify bias** - in AI responses and their own thinking
- **Construct arguments** - by critiquing AI reasoning
- **Make evidence-based decisions** - weighing pros and cons
- **Consider stakeholders** - beyond obvious parties

**Example Learning Outcome:**
Instead of "What would you do?" → "Evaluate these 4 approaches and justify your choice using professional standards."
