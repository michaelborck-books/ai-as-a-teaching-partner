# Accessibility and Inclusive AI Integration

## Introduction

AI integration in education creates new opportunities but also new barriers. This chapter addresses how to ensure AI-enhanced teaching benefits all students, regardless of their abilities, backgrounds, or circumstances.

**Core principle:** AI should expand educational access, not create new forms of exclusion. Inclusive design isn't optional—it's essential for ethical and effective education.
