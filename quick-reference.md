##  3 Techniques to Try This Week

### 1. **Conversation Practice**
```
You are an experienced HR manager conducting a termination meeting for poor performance. I am the employee being terminated.

Start conversation professionally but with empathy. Include:
- Clear explanation of decision
- Specific performance issues
- Next steps for employee
- Support resources available

Begin the conversation now.
```

### 2. **Critical Thinking Developer**  
```
Present this HR scenario to students:
"An employee has been consistently late for work, affecting team performance. Their manager wants to terminate them immediately."

First ask: "What should HR do and why?"

Then provide:
1. Multiple perspectives (legal, ethical, practical)
2. Pros and cons of different approaches
3. Stakeholder analysis
4. Long-term consequences
5. Professional standards

Ask students to evaluate your analysis.
```

### 3. **AI Debate Partner**
```
Present this HR policy: "Remote work should be available to all employees permanently."

You argue FOR this policy. I will argue AGAINST it.
After 3 rounds, summarize strongest arguments from both sides.
Then ask me to identify which arguments are most persuasive and why.
```
