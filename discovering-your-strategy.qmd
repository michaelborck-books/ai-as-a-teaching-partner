# Discovering Your Teaching Strategy: Using AI to Help You Use AI

## The Unique Power of AI

Here's something remarkable: **AI can teach you how to use itself.**

This is fundamentally different from traditional tools. Excel can't teach you how to use Excel. PowerPoint can't guide you through better presentations. Email can't help you email better.

But AI can.

Why? Because AI can:
- Ask you diagnostic questions to understand your context
- Learn about your specific teaching challenges and constraints
- Generate both obvious and unexpected recommendations
- Serve as a patient, tireless thinking partner
- Refine suggestions based on your feedback

This creates a unique opportunity: **You can use AI to discover how to use AI in ways that fit YOUR teaching context.**

Rather than reading a generic guide or following someone else's strategy, you can have a personalized consultation with AI that helps you figure out what actually matters for your discipline, your students, and your constraints.

## The Core Insight: Meta-Prompting

Instead of asking AI to directly solve a teaching problem, you can ask AI to help you figure out how to ask AI for help.

**Example comparison:**

| Direct Approach | Discovery Approach |
|---|---|
| "Generate discussion questions for my class" | "Ask me questions about my students and learning goals, then help me discover multiple ways AI could enhance discussion and critical thinking" |
| "How can I use AI in my teaching?" | "Interview me about my discipline, student cohort, and teaching philosophy. Then suggest both obvious and creative ways I could use AI that fit my context" |
| "What AI techniques should I learn?" | "Help me discover which techniques would solve my actual teaching challenges" |

The discovery approach is more powerful because **AI asks you clarifying questions first**, learns your context, and then provides recommendations tailored to your actual situation—not generic advice for a hypothetical educator.

## The Consultation Prompt: Your Starting Point

Here's a prompt you can use right now. Copy it, paste it into your AI tool (ChatGPT, Claude, Copilot, Gemini, etc.), and answer the questions honestly:

```
You're an AI expert consultant for business educators. I'd love your help
discovering how I could better use AI in my teaching.

Please ask me one question at a time. I'll answer, then you'll ask the next
question. Keep asking until you understand:

- My discipline and the students I teach (level, cohort size, background)
- My main teaching challenges and what I'm trying to help students learn
- My key teaching goals and what success looks like for my students
- My constraints (time, resources, technical skills, institutional requirements)
- What I've already tried and what excites or concerns me about AI

Once you have enough context, provide TWO types of recommendations:

1. OBVIOUS OPPORTUNITIES: Clear, straightforward AI applications
   (the things most educators think of)

2. NON-OBVIOUS OPPORTUNITIES: Unexpected or creative uses of AI specific
   to my discipline that I might not have considered

Format your recommendations clearly with implementation tips for each.

Please start by asking your first question.
```

**That's it.** Paste that prompt and start answering questions. You're about to have one of the most useful conversations about AI you could possibly have.

## Why This Works: The Interview Advantage

When you ask AI to interview you before making recommendations, several important things happen:

### 1. **Contextual Depth**

AI doesn't know anything about you initially. By asking sequential questions, it builds a comprehensive picture of:
- Your discipline (Is it HR management? Marketing? Accounting? Supply chain?) and how your students learn in that field
- Your teaching context (Are you working with first-years or postgraduates? Large cohorts or seminars? Practical or theoretical focus?)
- Your students' needs and challenges
- Your constraints and resources
- What success actually looks like for your teaching

This context is invaluable. Generic advice for "educators" doesn't account for whether you teach capstone projects, work with students from diverse backgrounds, manage compliance requirements, or work at an institution skeptical of AI. Context changes everything.

### 2. **Both Obvious and Non-Obvious Ideas**

AI tends to suggest obvious applications first. Those are valuable, but they're predictable.

By asking for both obvious *and* non-obvious recommendations, you push AI to think more creatively:

**Obvious:** Use AI to generate discussion questions for your seminar
**Non-obvious:** Use AI to analyse your students' questions and assignments to identify common misconceptions, then address them proactively in lectures
**Non-obvious:** Use AI to create assessment tasks that require authentic thinking (not just regurgitation) because they ask students to critique, improve, or apply AI-generated content
**Non-obvious:** Use AI to help you understand your students' diverse perspectives before class, so you can design more inclusive discussions

The non-obvious ideas are often where the real teaching value lies.

### 3. **Self-Evaluation and Refinement**

AI is remarkably good at evaluating its own suggestions. When it generates recommendations, it can:
- Assess which are most feasible for your context
- Identify trade-offs (e.g., "this saves you time but requires more tech setup")
- Refine implementation strategies based on your constraints
- Suggest combinations or variations

This creates a feedback loop where recommendations get better through iteration.

### 4. **Collaborative Discovery**

Unlike reading a guide or taking a course, this is a *conversation*. You're not passively receiving advice—you're actively shaping it by:
- Answering questions honestly about your actual context (not the ideal version)
- Pushing back on ideas that don't fit
- Asking follow-up questions about implementation
- Exploring implications for your students

The back-and-forth is where deep learning happens.

## A Real Example: What This Conversation Looks Like

Here's what a consultation might actually look like for a business educator:

### **Your Initial Prompt:**
*[You paste the consultation prompt above]*

### **AI's First Question:**
> "Thanks for that. Let's start with the basics. What's your primary teaching role? What discipline do you teach, and what level (undergraduate, postgraduate, both)?"

### **You:**
> "I teach financial analysis and audit in an undergraduate accounting program. I have 80-100 students across two cohorts, mostly domestic students who are serious about accounting careers."

### **AI's Next Question:**
> "That's helpful. What's your biggest teaching challenge right now? What's most difficult about helping these students learn financial analysis and audit?"

### **You:**
> "They struggle to see why this matters beyond 'passing the exam.' They memorize procedures but don't understand the judgment calls. And they're terrified of making mistakes in analysis, so they don't experiment or ask critical questions."

### **AI's Next Question:**
> "I understand. That's about building professional judgment and confidence, not just knowledge. Now, how much time do you currently spend on things that feel routine or repetitive? What takes time away from the deeper teaching?"

### **You:**
> "A lot, honestly. Creating variations of practice problems, explaining the same audit concepts different ways to different students, writing feedback on assignments that often gives the same guidance repeatedly."

### **AI's Next Question:**
> "So you're doing important work but some of it could be scaled. One more: What's one thing you wish your students understood better about how professionals actually think about financial analysis?"

### **You:**
> "That audit is about judgment and risk, not just following a checklist. Real auditors have to decide what matters, what risks are significant, what's worth investigating. That's thinking, not just process."

### **AI's Synthesis:**
> "Okay, I have enough context. Here are my recommendations:

> **OBVIOUS OPPORTUNITIES:**
> - Use AI to generate variations of practice problems with different scenarios, then have students work through them
> - Use AI to explain audit concepts from multiple angles (visual, narrative, step-by-step) for different learners
> - Use AI to help provide consistent feedback on assignments at scale
> - Use AI to generate sample audit findings with explanations of the judgment involved

> **NON-OBVIOUS OPPORTUNITIES:**
> - Use AI as a 'skeptical auditor' to critique students' audit plans before they execute them—teaching them to defend their judgments
> - Have students analyse AI-generated audit findings and critique whether the AI's conclusions are justified—building professional judgment
> - Use AI to create complex, messy scenarios (like real audit situations) that don't have obvious answers, then have students present their judgment and justify it
> - Use AI to help you identify patterns in student questions/mistakes, then design targeted interventions addressing the most common gaps
> - Create assessment tasks where students must improve, critique, or extend AI-generated audit analysis—this requires real thinking and can't be done by just using AI"

See the difference? The AI didn't just suggest "use AI for grading" or other generic ideas. It understood your specific discipline, your students' needs, and your teaching philosophy. The recommendations are contextual and actionable.

## How to Use This Chapter With the Rest of the Book

This chapter is foundational because it helps you **discover your own starting point**. After using AI to interview you, you might then:

### 1. **Dive Deeper Into Specific Techniques**

Based on what AI recommends, you can explore relevant chapters:

- **If AI suggests creating practice scenarios or simulations:**
  → Explore Chapter 5 (Flight Simulator) and Chapter 10 (Virtual Company)

- **If AI recommends using prompts to help students think through problems:**
  → Explore Chapter 4 (Seven Essential Techniques) and Chapter 12 (Static to Interactive)

- **If AI suggests helping students develop judgment and critique skills:**
  → Explore Chapter 6 (Critique Toolkit) and Chapter 8 (Ethics & Integrity)

- **If AI recommends assessment redesign:**
  → Explore Chapter 9 (Process Assessment) and Chapter 11 (Unit Design)

- **If AI suggests handling research or extended student work:**
  → Explore Chapter 13 (Research Assistant)

### 2. **Use AI to Help You Learn From Other Chapters**

After the consultation, you can ask AI to help you understand how other techniques apply to your context:

```
"I just read about the Seven Techniques in Chapter 4. I teach [your discipline].
Based on my teaching challenges, which of these techniques would be most useful
for me? Help me understand how I'd actually apply each one to my students."
```

Or:

```
"I'm reading about prompt chaining in Chapter 14. I want to help my students
develop [specific skill]. Can you suggest a 4-5 step prompt chain that would
help them practice this, tailored to my discipline?"
```

This way, you're not just reading generic guidance—you're using AI to understand how the book's content applies to *your* teaching.

### 3. **Return to This Chapter Periodically**

Your teaching context evolves. Run this consultation quarterly or whenever your situation changes:

- New semester, new cohort demographics
- Changed institutional requirements or policies
- New teaching challenges emerging
- You've tried something and want to explore what's next

Each time, you'll discover new opportunities you're ready for now that you weren't before. This keeps your AI strategy aligned with your evolving teaching priorities.

## The Deeper Principle: AI as a Thinking Mirror

Here's what's really happening when you ask AI to interview you:

**AI acts as a mirror for your own thinking.**

By asking clarifying questions, AI forces you to articulate:
- What you actually teach (vs. what you think you teach)
- What matters most to your students (vs. what's just on the exam)
- What's possible with your constraints (vs. what feels impossible)
- What you haven't tried (because you didn't know it was possible)

Often, the value of this conversation isn't the AI's recommendations—**it's the clarity you gain about your own teaching by having to explain it.**

Educators report things like:
- "I didn't realize how much time I was spending on feedback until the AI asked about it—now I see where AI could help"
- "Talking through my teaching goals, I realized my students need more practice with judgment, not more information"
- "Just articulating my teaching philosophy to the AI helped me see how AI could actually enhance it, not replace it"
- "I'd been assuming AI wasn't relevant to my discipline, but through the interview I discovered three ways it could help"

The AI is a thinking partner, not a replacement for your thinking.

## Practical Tips for Your Consultation

### **Be Honest and Specific**

Don't try to impress the AI with polished answers. The more honest you are about:
- What you're struggling with
- Your constraints and limitations
- Your concerns about AI
- What you've already tried

...the better the recommendations will be. If you say "I only have 2 hours a week for this" or "My students are skeptical of AI" or "I don't have technical skills," that's valuable context, not a weakness.

### **Ask Follow-Up Questions**

After AI gives you recommendations, don't just accept them. Ask:
- "How would I actually implement the non-obvious ones in my classroom?"
- "Which of these could I realistically start with this week?"
- "What are the risks or drawbacks of each approach?"
- "How would I know if this is actually working with my students?"
- "How does this fit with my existing assessment structure?"

### **Test One Obvious, One Non-Obvious**

After the consultation:
1. Pick ONE obvious recommendation and ONE non-obvious recommendation
2. Try each one with your students over a 2-3 week period
3. Pay attention to what happens: Do students engage differently? Does your work change?
4. Report back to the same conversation: "I tried [recommendation]. Here's what happened..."
5. AI will help you iterate toward what works in your context

### **Treat It as Ongoing**

This isn't a one-time conversation:
- Your context changes; your teaching evolves
- Student cohorts are different each year
- Institutional requirements shift
- Run this consultation again in 3–6 months
- Each time you'll be ready for different ideas

Document what you've tried and what's working. When you re-run the consultation, share that history so AI understands your evolution.

### **Share What You Learn**

If you discover something useful, share it with colleagues:
- "I asked AI to interview me about my teaching, and it suggested [X]. Here's how it's working..."
- Others might try similar approaches
- Collectively, your faculty learns what's possible with AI in your discipline

## The Meta-Moment: You're Using AI to Help You Use AI to Help Your Students

Here's the beautiful irony:

You're using this chapter to understand how to use AI to discover how to use AI better with your students.

That's very meta.

But it's also very practical. And very powerful.

> **The best tool for learning how to use AI is AI itself.**

The discovery conversation you're about to have with AI will teach you more about your own teaching than almost anything else. You'll gain clarity about:
- What you actually value in your teaching
- What your students truly struggle with
- Where your expertise lies (hint: nowhere an AI can replace you)
- What's possible when you leverage AI thoughtfully

Lean into that. Ask questions. Be honest about your context. Let AI surprise you with ideas you hadn't considered.

**That's where the real value emerges.**

## Your Action Step: Start Your Consultation Right Now

1. **Open your AI tool** (ChatGPT, Claude, Copilot, Gemini—any of them)
2. **Copy the consultation prompt** from the beginning of this chapter (or the discipline-specific variation that fits you)
3. **Paste it and send it**
4. **Answer the questions honestly** as they come—no polished answers needed
5. **Let the conversation unfold naturally** over 4-6 questions
6. **Review the recommendations** and pick one or two to try this month
7. **Report back** to the same conversation with what you learned
8. **Keep exploring** by asking follow-up questions

That's it. You're using AI to help you use AI better.

---

## Before You Move Forward

Don't just read this chapter and move on. Actually have the consultation. Spend 10-15 minutes in conversation with AI about your teaching.

Then return to this chapter and decide which other chapters to explore based on what AI recommended.

The rest of this book is powerful, but it's most powerful when you know *why* you're learning it—because it solves a challenge or enables a goal that matters to your specific teaching.

**This chapter helps you figure out your "why."**

Once you know that, everything else in the book becomes more actionable and more valuable.
