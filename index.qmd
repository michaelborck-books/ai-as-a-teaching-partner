## A Core Concept: Prompting as Foundation

Throughout this book, **prompting** is your core skill. Whether you're:

- Writing direct instructions to AI tools
- Integrating AI into familiar software (Word, PowerPoint, Teams)
- Automating workflows with agents
- Building custom tools

...you're fundamentally communicating with AI through prompts. Master prompting, and you can adapt to any AI tool,past, present, or future. **Chapters 2-4 teach you prompting as a conceptual foundation; everything else applies that foundation to specific teaching challenges.**

# The Core Philosophy

Three principles underpin everything in this book:

**1. AI as Scaffolding, Not Replacement**

You are the expert educator. AI is a tool that helps you scale what you already know works,personalised practice, immediate feedback, realistic simulations. AI builds the framework quickly; you ensure it's pedagogically sound and academically rigorous.

*How this applies to your discipline:*

::: {.panel-tabset}

# Business & Marketing
AI generates competitive analysis frameworks and customer segmentation scenarios. You validate the business logic, ensure market assumptions are sound, and teach students to question data sources and market trends.

# Management
AI creates organisational scenarios and change management workflows. You ensure they reflect real organisational complexity, teach students about stakeholder dynamics, and guide reflection on ethical leadership implications.

# Human Resources
AI generates candidate profiles and HR scenarios. You ensure they reflect realistic workplace situations, teach students about bias in hiring, and guide ethical decision-making about employee relations.

# Tourism & Hospitality
AI creates customer journey scenarios and service recovery simulations. You ensure they reflect authentic tourism contexts, teach cultural sensitivity, and guide experience design thinking.

# Supply Chain
AI generates demand forecasts and logistics scenarios. You validate the economic logic, teach supply chain trade-offs, and guide systems thinking about global complexity.

# Information Systems
AI generates system requirements and IT scenarios. You ensure technical feasibility, teach about legacy system constraints, and guide project management realities.

# Accounting & Finance
AI generates financial scenarios and compliance workflows. You ensure accuracy, teach professional standards, and guide ethical judgment in ambiguous situations.

# Economics
AI generates economic scenarios and policy simulations. You ensure theoretical soundness, teach empirical rigor, and guide students to understand limitations of models.

**2. Transparency Over Prohibition**

Rather than trying to prevent AI use (impossible and counterproductive), we teach students to use AI openly, critically, and ethically. This prepares them for professional practice where AI tools are standard across all business disciplines.

**3. Start Small, Scale Gradually**

You don't need to revolutionize your entire curriculum overnight. Start with one prompt, one assignment, one semester. Build confidence and capability progressively.

# Acknowledgments

This book synthesises ideas from multiple sources:

- Prompt engineering techniques adapted for professional education contexts
- Curtin University program information and learning outcomes
- Pedagogical frameworks from experiential learning, reflective practice, and authentic assessment
- Professional practice standards and ethical guidelines across business disciplines
- Emerging research on AI in higher education

The goal is not to be cutting-edge or technically impressive. The goal is to help business educators do their work better,prepare confident, competent, ethical professionals for complex workplaces.

# Important Notes

## Technology Changes Rapidly

AI tools evolve quickly. Specific platform names (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.) and capabilities described here reflect the state of technology in early 2025. The principles and pedagogical approaches remain relevant even as specific tools change.

## Context Matters

This book was developed for Curtin University's business programs. If you're at a different institution or teaching a different discipline, you'll need to adapt examples, learning outcomes, and institutional references. The frameworks are transferable; the specifics may not be.

## This Is a Starting Point

Consider this book a foundation, not a complete solution. You'll discover what works for your students, your teaching style, and your context through experimentation. The appendices provide templates you can adapt and build upon.

# A Personal Note to Readers

If you're feeling skeptical about AI in education, that's healthy. Technology is not inherently good or bad,it's how we use it that matters.

If you're worried this is too technical, I promise it's not. If you can write an email, you can write an AI prompt.

If you're concerned about losing control of your teaching, you won't. You'll gain new capabilities while maintaining your pedagogical judgment and professional expertise.

The goal of this book is simple: **by the end, you should feel excited and equipped to try one new thing in your next class.**

That's it. One simulation. One new assessment approach. One conversation where a student gets to practice being a business professional in a safe environment before they face real workplace challenges.

Because ultimately, that's what we're here for.

Let's begin.
