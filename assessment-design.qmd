# Assessment Design and Evaluation Rubrics

## Introduction

Throughout this book, we've emphasized **process-based assessment** over product-based evaluation. This chapter provides the concrete tools and rubrics needed to implement this approach effectively across all business disciplines.

The fundamental shift is from **"What did the AI produce?"** to **"How did the student think, evaluate, and improve?"** This requires new assessment criteria and evaluation frameworks.

**For the conceptual foundation and specific assessment models that these rubrics evaluate, see Chapter 11: Process Over Product - Rethinking Assessment.**

## Core Assessment Principles

### 1. Process Transparency
Students must show their thinking process, not just final output. This includes:
- Initial prompts and iterations
- Critical evaluation of AI responses
- Evidence of decision-making
- Reflection on improvements made

### 2. Critical Engagement
Assess how students interact with AI, not whether they use it:
- Quality of prompts crafted
- Identification of AI errors or biases
- Integration of domain knowledge
- Professional judgment applied

### 3. Authentic Application
Evaluate whether students can apply AI outputs in realistic contexts:
- Contextual adaptation of AI suggestions
- Integration with course concepts
- Professional communication skills
- Stakeholder consideration

### 4. Metacognitive Development
Assess students' ability to reflect on their own learning:
- Self-assessment accuracy
- Identification of knowledge gaps
- Strategy refinement
- Transfer of skills to new contexts
