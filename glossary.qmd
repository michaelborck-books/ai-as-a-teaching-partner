# Glossary

This glossary provides definitions for key terms and concepts used throughout the book. Terms are listed alphabetically.

## A

**AI (Artificial Intelligence)**: Software systems that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as pattern recognition, decision-making, language understanding, and problem-solving.

**AI Ethics**: The study of moral principles and guidelines for the responsible development and use of artificial intelligence systems.

**AI Literacy**: The ability to understand, evaluate, and effectively use AI systems and their outputs.

**Assessment Rubrics**: Structured evaluation criteria used to assess student work against specific learning outcomes and standards.

## B

**Bias in AI**: Systematic errors in AI systems that result in unfair or discriminatory outcomes, often due to biased training data or algorithmic design.

## C

**Chain of Thought**: A prompting technique where AI is guided to show its reasoning step-by-step, rather than jumping directly to a final answer.

**CRAFT Framework**: A structured approach to writing effective prompts, consisting of:
- **C**: Context (background information)
- **R**: Role (AI persona to adopt)
- **A**: Action (specific task to perform)
- **F**: Format (desired output structure)
- **T**: Tone/Target (intended audience and style)

**Critical Engagement**: The practice of actively questioning, evaluating, and critiquing AI outputs rather than accepting them passively.

## D

**Deep Learning**: A subset of machine learning using neural networks with multiple layers to process complex patterns and data.

**Dialogue-Based Assessment**: Assessment methods that evaluate student thinking through interactive conversations rather than static products.

## E

**Evidence-Based Practice**: Professional decision-making grounded in research, data, and systematic evaluation rather than intuition alone.

## F

**Few-Shot Learning**: AI's ability to learn and perform tasks from just a few examples, rather than requiring extensive training data.

## G

**Generative AI**: AI systems that can create new content, such as text, images, or code, rather than just analysing existing data.

## H

**Hallucination**: When AI generates false or misleading information confidently, as if it were factual.

**Human Oversight**: The practice of humans reviewing, validating, and intervening in AI processes to ensure accuracy and ethical outcomes.

## I

**Iterative Refinement**: The process of repeatedly improving AI outputs through feedback and revision cycles.

## L

**Large Language Models (LLMs)**: Advanced AI models trained on vast amounts of text data to understand and generate human-like language. Examples include ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini.

**Learning Outcomes**: Specific statements describing what students should know, understand, or be able to do after completing a learning experience.

## M

**Machine Learning**: A type of AI where systems learn patterns from data and improve performance without being explicitly programmed for each task.

**Meta-Prompting**: Using AI to help you create better prompts for AI, essentially using AI to improve your AI interactions.

**Metacognition**: Awareness and control of one's own learning processes, including planning, monitoring, and evaluating learning strategies.

## P

**Process-Based Assessment**: Evaluation methods that focus on how students think and work through problems, rather than just the final product or answer.

**Product-Based Assessment**: Traditional evaluation methods that focus primarily on the final output or result, rather than the thinking process.

**Prompt Engineering**: The practice of crafting effective instructions (prompts) to get desired outputs from AI systems.

**Prompting**: The act of providing instructions or questions to AI systems to elicit specific responses or behaviours.

## R

**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: A technique where AI combines its training knowledge with real-time data retrieval to provide more accurate and current information.

**Rubrics**: Detailed scoring guides that specify criteria for different levels of performance on assessment tasks.

## S

**Scaffolding**: Educational support structures that help students achieve tasks they couldn't accomplish independently, gradually removed as competence develops.

**Self-Assessment**: The process where students evaluate their own work and learning progress against established criteria.

## T

**Transparency Model**: An approach to AI integration where students openly acknowledge AI use, submit their interaction history, and critically evaluate AI outputs.

**Transfer Learning**: AI's ability to apply knowledge learned from one task to perform well on related tasks.

## V

**Virtual Company**: Simulated business environments created through AI conversations, allowing students to practice professional scenarios safely.</content>
