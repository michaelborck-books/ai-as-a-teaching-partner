# Getting Started - Your First AI Conversation

## What You'll Do in This Chapter

In the next 15 minutes, you're going to have your first productive conversation with an AI tool. By the end of this chapter, you'll understand:

- How to access free AI tools (no installation required)
- What a "prompt" actually is
- How to write clear instructions that get useful results
- The difference between a weak prompt and a powerful one
- How to think about AI as a teaching assistant, not a magic oracle

Let's jump straight in.

## Step 1: Accessing an AI Tool

If you're a **Curtin University staff member**, you have an approved enterprise option. Otherwise, you have several free options.

### Option A: MS Copilot Enterprise (Curtin Staff - Recommended)

### Summary: Which Tool to Choose?

| Tool | Best For | Data Protection | Office Integration |
|,,|,,,-|,,,,,--|,,,,,,-|
| **MS Copilot Enterprise (Curtin)** | Institutional work, course materials, student assignments | ✅ Enterprise-protected | ✅ Full MS Office Suite |
| **ChatGPT** | General exploration, standalone use | ⚠️ Consumer retention | ✓ Manual export (Pro) |
| **Claude** | Writing and nuanced analysis | ⚠️ Consumer retention | ✗ None |
| **Google Gemini** | Google Workspace users | ⚠️ Google policies | ✓ Google Workspace |

**For Curtin Staff & Students:** Use MS Copilot Enterprise for anything involving course materials, student work, or institutional data.

**For General Exploration:** Any tool works,they all have similar core capabilities.

**Note:** You don't need to download anything or configure complex settings. All options work directly in your web browser. If you're at Curtin, start with MS Copilot Enterprise. If you're elsewhere or just exploring, ChatGPT is the most familiar starting point.

## Step 2: Understanding Prompts

A **prompt** is simply the instruction or question you type into the AI tool. Think of it like briefing a very capable research assistant who:

- Has read an enormous amount of material on nearly every subject
- Can generate text, analyse situations, and role-play scenarios
- Follows your instructions literally (which is both powerful and requires precision)
- Doesn't have opinions, emotions, or genuine understanding,just pattern recognition

The quality of what you get back depends almost entirely on the quality of your prompt.

### Why Prompts Matter: The Foundation of All AI

Here's something important to understand: **Every AI tool, no matter how sophisticated, is fundamentally powered by prompts.**

Whether you're:
- Typing directly into ChatGPT
- Using MS Copilot in Word
- Working with specialized teaching tools
- Exploring emerging automation platforms
- Building custom agents

...at the heart, there's a prompt (or series of prompts) that tells the AI what to do.

**The anatomy of every AI interaction:**

```
System Prompt (hidden): "You are a helpful AI assistant for education..."
[Optional: Rules, context, instructions about how to behave]

User Prompt (your input): "Create a quiz about supply chain management"

Result: AI output based on both prompts combined
```

**Why this matters:**
- Learning to write clear prompts is learning to communicate effectively with AI
- Whether it's a standalone tool or integrated into Word, the principles are the same
- When you see AI integrated into traditional software (increasingly common), you're seeing a prompt window embedded in familiar tools
- Understanding prompts gives you conceptual mastery,specific tools will change, but prompting skills transfer

**Your progression in this book:**
1. **Chapter 2-4** (this section): Master basic prompting concepts and techniques
2. **Chapters 5-12**: Apply prompting to specific teaching scenarios
3. **Chapter 13**: Transform static content to interactive using prompts
4. **Chapter 14**: See how prompts scale through automation and agents

This chapter teaches you the foundation. Everything else builds on it.

Let's see prompts in action.

## Your First Prompt: The Weak Version

Open your chosen AI tool and type this exactly:

```
Write a case study about business.
```

Hit enter and see what you get.

You'll probably receive something generic,maybe a story about a marketing campaign or a financial decision. It's *fine*, but it's not particularly useful for your specific teaching needs.

**Why was this weak?** Because the prompt was vague. "Business" covers everything from accounting to marketing. "A case study" could be 100 words or 5,000 words. The AI had to guess what you wanted.

## Your Second Prompt: The Powerful Version

Now try this. Copy and paste the prompt that matches your discipline:

::: {.panel-tabset}

Begin.
```

:::

Hit enter.

**Notice the difference?** The AI now knows:
- What role to adopt (expert lecturer in YOUR discipline)
- Who the audience is (undergraduate students)
- What specific learning objective you're targeting (discipline-specific skill)
- What the scenario should contain (field-specific challenge)
- How long it should be (300-400 words)
- What format you want (scenario + three discussion questions)

The output should be dramatically more useful. It's tailored to your discipline, specific, and ready to use in your class (with your refinement, of course).

## The CRAFT Framework: One Approach to Structured Prompting

Let's break down what made that second prompt powerful using a **memorable framework**: **CRAFT**.

This framework works whether you're using ChatGPT, Copilot, Claude, or any other AI tool. CRAFT is a helpful **starting point** for structuring your thinking.

**Important caveat:** CRAFT is not the only way to prompt effectively. Some educators find other frameworks work better for them. Some prefer different approaches entirely. The goal isn't to follow CRAFT rigidly,it's to **think intentionally about what you're asking the AI to do**.

### The CRAFT Acronym

| Letter | Element | Example |
|,,--|,,,|,,,|
| **C** | **Context** | "This is for my undergraduate marketing unit covering competitive strategy" |
| **R** | **Role** | "You are an experienced marketing director" |
| **A** | **Action** | "Create a case study about a product launch decision" |
| **F** | **Format** | "300-400 words with three discussion questions at the end" |
| **T** | **Tone/Target** | "Professional and realistic, suitable for university students" |

**You don't need to use every element every time**, but this gives you a clear structure to work with.

### Breaking Down Each Element

#### C: **Context** - Set the situation
> "This is for my undergraduate marketing unit. Students have learned about competitive positioning and market analysis."

Why it matters: Helps AI understand what background knowledge students already have and what level of sophistication to aim for.

Discipline examples:

::: {.panel-tabset}

## Business & Marketing
"This is for an introductory marketing course where students are learning about digital customer acquisition strategies."

## Management
"This is for a management unit on organisational change where students have covered Kotter's 8-step model."

## Human Resources
"This is for an HR management course on employee relations and conflict resolution."

## Tourism & Hospitality
"This is for a hospitality management unit focused on service recovery and customer experience design."

## Supply Chain & Logistics
"This is for a supply chain management course on disruption management and network resilience."

## Information Systems
"This is for an IT project management unit where students have learned agile and waterfall approaches."

## Accounting & Finance
"This is for an intermediate accounting course on financial analysis and audit methodology."

## Economics
"This is for a microeconomics course on market structures and competitive dynamics."

:::

#### R: **Role** - Define the perspective
> "You are an experienced marketing director"

Why it matters: The role shapes the tone, vocabulary, and approach. "Marketing director" will sound different from "market researcher" even when discussing the same topic.

Discipline examples:

::: {.panel-tabset}

## Business & Marketing
"You are an experienced marketing director launching a new product" or "You are a market research analyst evaluating competitive positioning"

## Management
"You are a senior manager navigating organisational change" or "You are an executive coach helping with team dynamics"

## Human Resources
"You are an HR business partner handling sensitive employee situations" or "You are a recruitment specialist evaluating candidate fit"

## Tourism & Hospitality
"You are a hotel general manager managing service delivery" or "You are a guest services trainer improving customer experience"

## Supply Chain & Logistics
"You are a supply chain manager handling network optimization" or "You are a logistics director managing disruption"

## Information Systems
"You are an IT project manager implementing enterprise systems" or "You are a systems analyst gathering requirements"

## Accounting & Finance
"You are an auditor evaluating financial statements" or "You are a financial analyst making investment recommendations"

## Economics
"You are an economist advising on policy decisions" or "You are a researcher analysing economic trends"

:::

#### A: **Action** - Specify what to create
> "Create a case study about a product launch decision"

Why it matters: Be specific about what you want. "Create a case study" is clearer than "write something about strategy."

#### F: **Format** - Describe the structure
> "300-400 words with three discussion questions at the end"

Why it matters: Format constraints guide the AI and prevent it from delivering something unusable. Too long? Too short? Wrong structure? Format prevents that.

Examples:
- "Bullet point list with 5-7 items"
- "Conversational dialogue between two characters"
- "Table with three columns: Challenge, Strategy, Outcome"
- "Step-by-step instructions numbered 1-10"

#### T: **Tone/Target** - Set the style and level
> "Professional and realistic, suitable for university students who are new to this topic"

Why it matters: This prevents the AI from pitching too high (too academic) or too low (too simplistic).

Examples by level:
- **Introductory:** "Use simple, clear language. Avoid jargon."
- **Intermediate:** "Assume students understand basic concepts. Use professional terminology."
- **Advanced:** "Use sophisticated analysis. Reference theoretical frameworks and empirical research."

,

### Alternative Approaches: There's More Than One Way

CRAFT is helpful, but it's not the only effective prompting approach. Depending on your thinking style and what you're trying to achieve, these alternatives might work better:

#### **Ask for Step-by-Step Thinking**

Instead of relying on CRAFT structure, ask the AI to show its reasoning:

```
"I need a supply chain risk analysis. Before you give me recommendations,
walk me through your thinking: What are the main risk categories?
What information would help identify which risks matter most?
Then provide your analysis."
```

This gets at how the AI thinks, not just what it outputs.

#### **Provide Examples of What You Want**

Sometimes showing is better than telling:

```
"Here's what a GOOD case study looks like for my students:
[example of strong case study from your files]

Here's what a WEAK case study looks like:
[example of weak case study]

Now create a case study for [your topic] that matches the GOOD example's quality."
```

This uses your expertise to calibrate the AI, rather than relying on CRAFT's generic structure.

#### **Request Comparative Approaches**

Ask the AI to explore multiple angles:

```
"Show me three different ways to explain this accounting concept:
1. For a student who learns visually
2. For a student who learns through examples
3. For a student who prefers logical frameworks

Then tell me which approach seems most effective."
```

This creates conversation and exploration, not just output.

#### **Use Iterative Exploration**

Start vague, then get more specific as you see what the AI generates:

```
PROMPT 1: "What are the key ethical issues in AI implementation in healthcare?"
[AI responds with 5 issues]

PROMPT 2: "Which of those is most relevant to Australian healthcare compliance?"
[AI elaborates on one issue]

PROMPT 3: "How would you teach students to analyze this issue?"
[AI proposes teaching approach]

PROMPT 4: "What's a scenario that would help students understand this?"
[AI creates scenario you can then refine]
```

Notice: you don't need a perfect first prompt. You explore together.

,

### The Philosophy: Conversation Over One-Shot Prompting

Here's a crucial insight: **One-shot prompts (even well-structured CRAFT ones) tend to produce "AI sameness."**

When you send one prompt and take the output as-is, you get:
- Generic content that could work for anyone
- Safe middle-ground responses
- Missing your specific teaching voice and perspective
- The same tone the AI uses for every other prompt

**The solution: Have a conversation.**

Real teaching improvement comes from iterative exploration where:
- You share your thinking ("Here's what I want students to understand...")
- The AI responds ("Here are three ways to approach this...")
- You push back or build ("Good, but can we make it less academic?" or "Add this element...")
- The result emerges through back-and-forth

This is why the **Seven Techniques** (in Chapter 4) matter more than perfect prompt structure. Techniques like Chain of Thought, Pros/Cons Analysis, and Role Play are **conversation tools**,they invite the AI to think alongside you, not just execute your commands.

,

### Complete CRAFT Example

Here's how all five elements work together:

```
Context: "This is for my undergraduate Business course on marketing strategy."

Role: "You are an experienced marketing director."

Action: "Create a case study about a product launch decision where the company faces competitive threats."

Format: "300-400 words with three discussion questions requiring students to analyse market strategy and positioning."

Tone/Target: "Professional and realistic. Use clear language suitable for first-year university students."
```

This is the "powerful" prompt we tried earlier. Now you can see **why** it's powerful,it includes all five CRAFT elements.

,

### CRAFT as a Starting Point, Not the Endpoint

Here's something crucial: **CRAFT is your first message, not your only message.**

The best results come from **conversations**, not one-shot commands.

#### Why This Matters

If you use CRAFT and stop, you get:
- A competent response
- But it's generic and somewhat "AI-sounding"
- Likely missing your teaching perspective
- Probably not exactly what you actually need

If you use CRAFT and then **have a conversation**, you get:
- Content shaped by your specific context
- Your teaching voice reflected in the output
- Solutions to problems the first prompt didn't anticipate
- Something genuinely useful for YOUR students

#### The Conversation Pattern

After your initial CRAFT prompt, you can:
1. **Refine:** "Can you make the discussion questions more challenging?"
2. **Expand:** "Add a section about the financial impact of this decision."
3. **Adapt:** "Rewrite this for postgraduate students instead of undergraduates."
4. **Repurpose:** "Turn this into a 10-slide PowerPoint presentation."
5. **Push back:** "That's too generic. Here's what I actually need..." and keep talking

You're not just telling the AI what to do,you're **working together** to get exactly what you need.

This conversation approach is why **Chapters 4-7 focus on techniques (Reverse Prompting, Pros/Cons, Chain of Thought, etc.) rather than just prompting structure.** Those techniques are conversation starters, not rigid templates.

## Practice Exercise: Your Turn

Now it's your turn to write a prompt from scratch. Think of something you currently teach in your business course,a topic where you wish you had more practice materials or better scenarios.

Use this template:

```
You are [define the role].

I need you to [state the specific task] for [define your audience].

Here are the requirements:
- [Requirement 1]
- [Requirement 2]
- [Requirement 3]

[Any additional context or constraints]

Begin.
```

:::

Type your prompt into the AI tool and see what happens.

## What to Expect (and Not Expect)

As you experiment, keep these realities in mind:

### What AI Does Well:
- Generates diverse scenarios and examples quickly
- Creates consistent, well-structured text
- Role-plays different perspectives convincingly
- Provides frameworks and outlines
- Analyzes text against criteria you define

### What AI Doesn't Do:
- Understand context the way humans do
- Have actual expertise or professional judgment
- Know your specific students, university policies, or local employment laws
- Guarantee factual accuracy (it can confidently state incorrect information)
- Replace your pedagogical design or assessment judgment

**The golden rule:** AI is a powerful draft generator and practice partner. You are still the expert who evaluates, refines, and ensures accuracy.

,

## Beyond Your First Prompt: The Follow-Up Conversation

Here's the secret that most people miss: **the best results come from a conversation, not a single prompt.**

Your first CRAFT prompt gets you started. Your follow-up prompts make it actually useful for your teaching.

### Common Follow-Up Patterns

After your initial CRAFT prompt generates something, you can have a conversation to refine it:

#### Pattern 1: **Refine for Your Exact Needs**

**Initial prompt:** CRAFT framework generates a case study

**Follow-up:** "Can you make the discussion questions more challenging? Students should need to apply the frameworks we've covered, not just recall information."

**Why this works:** The AI understood your context from the first prompt. Now you're fine-tuning toward excellence.

#### Pattern 2: **Adapt for Different Audiences**

**Initial prompt:** Generate a finance case study for undergraduate students

**Follow-up:** "Rewrite this for postgraduate students. Assume they understand ratio analysis and want more sophisticated valuation challenges."

**Why this works:** The core content doesn't need to be regenerated; it just needs repositioning.

#### Pattern 3: **Expand with Additional Dimensions**

**Initial prompt:** Create an HR scenario

**Follow-up:** "Add a section about the legal and compliance implications. Include references to relevant employment law."

**Why this works:** You're building on what works rather than starting from scratch.

#### Pattern 4: **Repurpose Into Multiple Formats**

**Initial prompt:** Generate a supply chain analysis framework

**Follow-up 1:** "Turn this into a 10-slide PowerPoint with speaker notes."
**Follow-up 2:** "Create a checklist version students can print and use in class."
**Follow-up 3:** "Write a 2-minute explanation of this framework for a podcast."

**Why this works:** One good idea becomes multiple teaching assets.

### Real Example: Conversation in Action

Here's how a conversation might unfold:

```
PROMPT 1 (Initial CRAFT):
Context: "This is for my second-year marketing unit on competitive strategy."
Role: "You are an experienced marketing director."
Action: "Create a market analysis case study."
Format: "500 words with 4 discussion questions"
Tone: "Professional, suitable for university students."

AI OUTPUT: [Case study about streaming service competition]

PROMPT 2 (Refine):
"Great! Can you make the discussion questions more specific?
Instead of asking 'What's wrong?' ask students to identify:
- Which Porter's Five Forces are most important here?
- How would you calculate market share?
- What data would you need to support your recommendation?"

AI OUTPUT: [Same case study, improved questions aligned with course framework]

PROMPT 3 (Expand):
"Add a section showing three different market analysis approaches
and how each one would lead to different conclusions. Include:
- Porter's Five Forces
- Ansoff Matrix
- SWOT analysis"

AI OUTPUT: [Expanded case study with multiple analytical frameworks]

PROMPT 4 (Repurpose):
"Turn this into a 10-minute classroom activity. Include:
- 2-minute scenario introduction for students
- 5-minute small group analysis task
- 3-minute discussion and comparison of frameworks"

AI OUTPUT: [Classroom activity structured for your timing]
```

Notice: you didn't write four prompts from scratch. You had a conversation where each follow-up built on what was working.

### Key Principle: You're the Director

Think of yourself as a **director**, not a subordinate giving orders.

- The AI is your assistant generating drafts
- You're evaluating, refining, and improving those drafts
- Each follow-up question shapes the output toward excellence
- You stop when it's ready for your class

This is what makes AI powerful for teaching: **you stay in control while multiplying your output quality.**

,

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

**"The AI gave me something too simple/complex."**
→ Add to your prompt: "Pitch this at the level of a third-year undergraduate student" or specify your context: "This is for students with no prior supply chain experience" or "Students already understand financial statement analysis."

**"The response was too short/long."**
→ Specify word count or structure: "Provide 500 words" or "Write exactly 5 paragraphs" or "Create a scenario followed by 4 discussion questions."

**"It's too generic,not specific to Australia/my context."**
→ Add context relevant to your discipline:

::: {.panel-tabset}

## Business & Marketing
"Set this in an Australian retail context" or "Reference Australian Consumer Law and ACCC regulations"

## Management
"Set this in an Australian public sector organisation" or "Reference Fair Work Act requirements"

## Human Resources
"Include Australian employment law and Fair Work Commission context" or "Reference Australian workplace discrimination law"

## Tourism & Hospitality
"Set this in an Australian hotel/tourism context" or "Reference Australian tourism industry standards"

## Supply Chain
"Set this in an Australian manufacturing context" or "Reference Australian logistics regulations"

## Information Systems
"Reference Australian Privacy Act and data protection requirements" or "Set in Australian banking context"

## Accounting & Finance
"Reference Australian Accounting Standards and ASIC rules" or "Use Australian tax law context"

## Economics

**"The AI ignored part of my prompt."**
→ This happens sometimes. Just follow up: "Please revise that to include [the missing element]."

**"I want to change just one part."**
→ You can have a conversation: "Keep everything the same, but make the scenario more realistic" or "Add a section about the ethical considerations" or discipline-specific tweaks like "Include regulatory compliance issues" or "Add supply chain complexity."

## Your First Win

If you've followed along, you've just:
1. Accessed an AI tool
2. Written a structured prompt
3. Generated a teaching resource you didn't have 5 minutes ago

That's not a small thing. You've learned the fundamental skill that everything else in this book builds on.

## Before You Move On

Try this homework before Chapter 3. Choose three prompts from your discipline:

::: {.panel-tabset}

## Business & Marketing
1. Generate market research questions for a competitor analysis
2. Role-play a demanding customer objecting to your product pricing
3. Analyse a marketing plan for strategic alignment and competitive position

## Management
1. Generate an organisational change scenario for students to analyse
2. Role-play a resistant employee in a change management conversation
3. Analyse a leadership decision for stakeholder impact

## Human Resources
1. Generate interview questions and evaluate them for bias
2. Role-play a difficult performance management conversation
3. Analyse an HR policy for legal compliance and fairness

## Tourism & Hospitality
1. Generate guest complaint scenarios for service recovery
2. Role-play a demanding guest in a difficult service situation
3. Analyse a service strategy for customer experience effectiveness

## Supply Chain & Logistics
1. Generate supply chain disruption scenarios with constraints
2. Role-play a demanding supplier in a negotiation
3. Analyse a logistics plan for efficiency and resilience

## Information Systems
1. Generate IT project requirements with stakeholder conflicts
2. Role-play a demanding stakeholder with unclear needs
3. Analyse a project plan for scope management and risk

## Accounting & Finance
1. Generate financial statements with errors for audit analysis
2. Role-play an auditor questioning a financial treatment
3. Analyse a valuation decision for accounting judgment

## Economics
1. Generate economic policy scenarios with trade-offs
2. Role-play an economist presenting competing models
3. Analyse an economic forecast for assumptions and limitations

Get comfortable with the basic rhythm: prompt → response → refine → use.

The more you practice, the more natural it becomes. And the more specific your prompts, the more useful your outputs.

## Why This Matters: Prompting as Transferable Skill

You now understand something crucial: **prompting is the core skill underneath all AI tools.**

Notice that whether you were using:
- ChatGPT
- MS Copilot in Word
- Claude
- Any other tool

...the prompting principles were identical. You set a role, defined context, specified requirements, and got results.

This matters because:

1. **Tools will change, skills will remain** - ChatGPT might be replaced. Copilot might evolve. But the ability to communicate clearly with AI? That's portable.

2. **Prompting scales** - The same prompting principles that work one-on-one with a tool also underlie:
   - Custom GPTs that serve your entire class
   - Automation workflows that generate content automatically
   - Agents that handle complex multi-step processes
   - RAG systems that ground AI in your course materials

3. **Integration is prompting in disguise** - When you see AI integrated into Word, PowerPoint, or emerging teaching tools, you're seeing a prompt window embedded in familiar software. The principles you just learned apply.

In the next chapters, you'll learn **specific prompting techniques** tailored to teaching. Then you'll apply them to increasingly sophisticated scenarios. All of it builds on what you've just learned here.

## A Note on Conversation Length and Context

When you start having longer conversations with AI,iterating on a unit design, asking follow-up questions, building on earlier work,you might eventually notice that outputs become less consistent or less accurate. This is a context management issue: as conversations grow very long, AI has limitations on what it can reliably track.

**Don't worry about this for simple prompts.** But as you move to more complex work, **see Chapter 6 (Managing LLM Context)** for strategies to keep conversations focused and high-quality. You'll learn techniques like:
- Breaking complex tasks into steps
- Starting new conversations when appropriate
- Explicitly restating context to keep AI on track

For now, just be aware: if a long conversation starts feeling unwieldy, that's normal. Chapter 6 shows you how to manage it.

**Next Chapter Preview:** In Chapter 3, you'll learn the week-by-week timeline for integrating AI into your teaching. Chapter 4 then introduces seven essential prompting **techniques**,specific approaches that develop different critical thinking skills in your students. Each technique is more sophisticated than "write a prompt," but all of them build on the foundations you've just mastered.
